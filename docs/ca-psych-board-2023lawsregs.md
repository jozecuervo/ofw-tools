However, the preceding seven-year limitation shall not apply in either of the following situations: (A) The applicant was convicted of a serious felony, as deÞned in Section 1192.7 of the Penal Code or a crime for which registration is required pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 290 of the Penal Code. (B) The applicant was convicted of a Þnancial crime currently classiÞed as a felony that is directly and adversely related to the Þduciary qualiÞ- cations, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the application is made, pursuant to regulations adopted by the board, and for which the applicant is seeking licensure under any of the following: (i) Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 3. (ii) Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3. (iii) Chapter 11.3 (commencing with Section 7512) of Division 3. BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE  (iv) Licensure as a funeral director or cemetery manager under Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 7600) of Division 3. (v) Division 4 (commencing with Section 10000). (2) The applicant has been subjected to formal discipline by a licensing board in or outside California within the preceding seven years from the date of application based on professional misconduct that would have been cause for discipline before the board for which the present application is made and that is substantially related to the qualiÞcations, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the present application is made. However, prior disciplinary action by a licensing board within the preceding seven years shall not be the basis for denial of a license if the basis for that disciplinary action was a conviction that has been dismissed pursuant to Section 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, 1203.42, or 1203.425 of the Penal Code or a comparable dismissal or expungement. Formal discipline that occurred earlier than seven years preceding the date of application may be grounds for denial of a license only if the formal discipline was for conduct that, if committed in this state by a physician and surgeon licensed pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2000) of Division 2, would have constituted an act of sexual abuse, misconduct, or relations with a patient pursuant to Section 726 or sexual exploitation as deÞned in subdivision (a) of Section 729. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a person shall not be denied a license on the basis that the person has been convicted of a crime, or on the basis of acts underlying a conviction for a crime, if that person has obtained a certiÞcate of rehabilitation under Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 4852.01) of Title 6 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, has been granted clemency or a pardon by a state or federal executive, or has made a showing of rehabilitation pursuant to Section 482. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a person shall not be denied a license on the basis of any conviction, or on the basis of the acts underlying the conviction, that has been dismissed pursuant to Section 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, 1203.42, or 1203.425 of the Penal Code, or a comparable dismissal or expungement. An applicant who has a conviction that has been dismissed pursuant to Section 1203.4, 1203.4a, 1203.41, or 1203.42 of the Penal Code shall provide proof of the dismissal if it is not reßected on the report furnished by the Department of Justice. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a board shall not deny a license on the basis of an arrest that resulted in a disposition other than a conviction, including an arrest that resulted in an infraction, citation, or a juvenile adjudication. (e) A board may deny a license regulated by this code on the ground that the applicant knowingly made a false statement of fact that is required to be revealed in the application for the license. A board shall not deny a license based solely on an applicantÕs failure to disclose a fact that would not have been cause for denial of the license had it been disclosed. Bus. & Prof. Code BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY  (f) A board shall follow the following procedures in requesting or acting on an applicantÕs criminal history information: (1) A board issuing a license pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 5500), Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 5615), Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 7301), Chapter 20 (commencing with Section 9800), or Chapter 20.3 (commencing with Section 9880), of Division 3, or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 19000) or Chapter 3.1 (commencing with Section 19225) of Division 8 may require applicants for licensure under those chapters to disclose criminal conviction history on an application for licensure. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (1), a board shall not require an applicant for licensure to disclose any information or documentation regard- ing the applicantÕs criminal history. However, a board may request mitigat- ing information from an applicant regarding the applicantÕs criminal history for purposes of determining substantial relation or demonstrating evidence of rehabilitation, provided that the applicant is informed that disclosure is voluntary and that the applicantÕs decision not to disclose any information shall not be a factor in a boardÕs decision to grant or deny an application for licensure. (3) If a board decides to deny an application for licensure based solely or Bus. & Prof. Code in part on the applicantÕs conviction history, the board shall notify the applicant in writing of all of the following: (A) The denial or disqualiÞcation of licensure. (B) Any existing procedure the board has for the applicant to challenge the decision or to request reconsideration. (C) That the applicant has the right to appeal the boardÕs decision. (D) The processes for the applicant to request a copy of the applicantÕs complete conviction history and question the accuracy or completeness of the record pursuant to Sections 11122 to 11127 of the Penal Code. (g)(1) For a minimum of three years, each board under this code shall retain application forms and other documents submitted by an applicant, any notice provided to an applicant, all other communications received from and provided to an applicant, and criminal history reports of an applicant. (2) Each board under this code shall retain the number of applications received for each license and the number of applications requiring inquiries regarding criminal history.

Grounds for suspension or revocation; Discipline for substan- tially related crimes; Conviction; Legislative Þndings (a) In addition to any other action that a board is permitted to take against a licensee, a board may suspend or revoke a license on the ground that the licensee has been convicted of a crime, if the crime is substantially related to the qualiÞcations, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the license was issued. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a board may exercise any authority to discipline a licensee for conviction of a crime that is independent of the authority granted under subdivision (a) only if the crime is substantially related to the qualiÞcations, functions, or duties of the business or profession for which the licenseeÕs license was issued. (c) A conviction within the meaning of this section means a plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere. An action that a board is permitted to take following the establishment of a conviction may be taken when the time for appeal has elapsed, or the judgment of conviction has been affirmed on appeal, or when an order granting probation is made suspending the imposition of sentence, irrespective of a subsequent order under Section 1203.4 of the Penal Code. (d) The Legislature hereby Þnds and declares that the application of this section has been made unclear by the holding in Petropoulos v. Department of Real Estate (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 554, and that the holding in that case has placed a signiÞcant number of statutes and regulations in question, resulting in potential harm to the consumers of California from licensees who have been convicted of crimes. Therefore, the Legislature Þnds and declares that this section establishes an independent basis for a board to impose discipline upon a licensee, and that the amendments to this section made by Chapter 33 of the Statutes of 2008 do not constitute a change to, but rather are declaratory of, existing law.  HISTORY: Added Stats 1974 ch 1321 ¤ 13.

Interim suspension or restriction order (a) A board or an administrative law judge sitting alone, as provided in subdivision (h), may, upon petition, issue an interim order suspending any licentiate or imposing license restrictions, including, but not limited to, mandatory biological ßuid testing, supervision, or remedial training. The petition shall include affidavits that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the board, both of the following: (1) The licentiate has engaged in acts or omissions constituting a violation of this code or has been convicted of a crime substantially related to the licensed activity. (2) Permitting the licentiate to continue to engage in the licensed activity, or permitting the licentiate to continue in the licensed activity without restrictions, would endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. (b) No interim order provided for in this section shall be issued without notice to the licentiate unless it appears from the petition and supporting documents that serious injury would result to the public before the matter could be heard on notice. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the licentiate shall be given at least 15 daysÕ notice of the hearing on the petition for an interim order. The notice shall include documents submitted to the board in support of the petition. If the order was initially issued without notice as provided in subdivision (b), the licentiate shall be entitled to a hearing on the petition within 20 days of the issuance of the interim order without notice. The licentiate shall be given notice of the hearing within two days after issuance of the initial interim order, and shall receive all documents in support of the petition. The failure of the board to provide a hearing within 20 days following the issuance of the interim order without notice, unless the licentiate waives his or her right to the hearing, shall result in the dissolution of the interim order by operation of law. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY  (d) At the hearing on the petition for an interim order, the licentiate may: (1) Be represented by counsel. (2) Have a record made of the proceedings, copies of which shall be available to the licentiate upon payment of costs computed in accordance with the provisions for transcript costs for judicial review contained in Section 11523 of the Government Code. (3) Present affidavits and other documentary evidence. (4) Present oral argument. (e) The board, or an administrative law judge sitting alone as provided in subdivision (h), shall issue a decision on the petition for interim order within Þve business days following submission of the matter. The standard of proof required to obtain an interim order pursuant to this section shall be a preponderance of the evidence standard. If the interim order was previously issued without notice, the board shall determine whether the order shall remain in effect, be dissolved, or modiÞed. (f) The board shall Þle an accusation within 15 days of the issuance of an interim order. In the case of an interim order issued without notice, the time shall run from the date of the order issued after the noticed hearing. If the licentiate Þles a Notice of Defense, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of the agencyÕs receipt of the Notice of Defense. A decision shall be rendered on the accusation no later than 30 days after submission of the matter. Failure to comply with any of the requirements in this subdivision shall dissolve the interim order by operation of law. (g) Interim orders shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and shall be heard only in the superior court in and for the Counties of Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego. The review of an interim order shall be limited to a determination of whether the board abused its discretion in the issuance of the interim order. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent board has not proceeded in the manner required by law, or if the court determines that the interim order is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. (h) The board may, in its sole discretion, delegate the hearing on any petition for an interim order to an administrative law judge in the Office of Administrative Hearings. If the board hears the noticed petition itself, an administrative law judge shall preside at the hearing, rule on the admission and exclusion of evidence, and advise the board on matters of law. The board shall exercise all other powers relating to the conduct of the hearing but may delegate any or all of them to the administrative law judge. When the petition has been delegated to an administrative law judge, he or she shall sit alone and exercise all of the powers of the board relating to the conduct of the hearing. A decision issued by an administrative law judge sitting alone shall be Þnal when it is Þled with the board. If the administrative law judge issues an interim order without notice, he or she shall preside at the noticed hearing, unless unavailable, in which case another administrative law judge may hear the matter.

Allegations of noncompliance with the interim order may be Þled at any time prior to the rendering of a decision on the accusation. Violation of the interim order is established upon proof that the licentiate was on notice of the interim order and its terms, and that the order was in effect at the time of the violation. The Þnding of a violation of an interim order made at the hearing on the accusation shall be reviewed as a part of any review of a Þnal decision of the agency. If the interim order issued by the agency provides for anything less than a complete suspension of the licentiate from his or her business or profession, and the licentiate violates the interim order prior to the hearing on the accusation provided for in subdivision (f), the agency may, upon notice to the licentiate and proof of violation, modify or expand the interim order. (j) A plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section. A certiÞed record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred. A board may take action under this section notwithstand- ing the fact that an appeal of the conviction may be taken. (k) The interim orders provided for by this section shall be in addition to, and not a limitation on, the authority to seek injunctive relief provided in any other provision of law. (l) In the case of a board, a petition for an interim order may be Þled by the executive officer. In the case of a bureau or program, a petition may be Þled by the chief or program administrator, as the case may be. (m) ÒBoard,Ó as used in this section, shall include any agency described in Section 22, and any allied health agency within the jurisdiction of the Medical Board of California.

A copy of this form shall be included with every notice sent pursuant to this subdivision. (h) If the applicant or licensee wishes to challenge the submission of their name on a certiÞed list, the applicant or licensee shall make a timely written request for release to the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable. The State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board shall immediately send a release to the appropriate state governmental licensing entity and the applicant or licensee, if any of the following conditions are met: (1) The applicant or licensee has complied with the tax obligation, either by payment of the unpaid taxes or entry into an installment payment agreement, as described in Section 6832 or 19008 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, to satisfy the unpaid taxes. (2) The applicant or licensee has submitted a request for release not later than 45 days after the applicantÕs or licenseeÕs receipt of a preliminary notice described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e), but the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, will be unable to complete the release review and send notice of its Þndings to the Bus. & Prof. Code BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE  applicant or licensee and state governmental licensing entity within 45 days after the State Board of EqualizationÕs or the Franchise Tax BoardÕs receipt of the applicantÕs or licenseeÕs request for release. Whenever a release is granted under this paragraph, and, notwithstanding that release, the applicable license or licenses have been suspended erroneously, the state governmental licensing entity shall reinstate the applicable licenses with retroactive effect back to the date of the erroneous suspension and that suspension shall not be reßected on any license record. Bus. & Prof. Code (3) The applicant or licensee is unable to pay the outstanding tax obligation due to a current Þnancial hardship. ÒFinancial hardshipÓ means Þnancial hardship as determined by the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, where the applicant or licensee is unable to pay any part of the outstanding liability and the applicant or licensee is unable to qualify for an installment payment arrangement as provided for by Section 6832 or Section 19008 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. In order to establish the existence of a Þnancial hardship, the applicant or licensee shall submit any information, including information related to reasonable business and personal expenses, re- quested by the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, for purposes of making that determination. (i) An applicant or licensee is required to act with diligence in responding to notices from the state governmental licensing entity and the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board with the recognition that the temporary license will lapse or the license suspension will go into effect after 90 days and that the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board must have time to act within that period. An applicantÕs or licenseeÕs delay in acting, without good cause, which directly results in the inability of the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, to complete a review of the applicantÕs or licenseeÕs request for release shall not constitute the diligence required under this section which would justify the issuance of a release. An applicant or licensee shall have the burden of establishing that they diligently responded to notices from the state govern- mental licensing entity or the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board and that any delay was not without good cause. (j) The State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board shall create release forms for use pursuant to this section. When the applicant or licensee has complied with the tax obligation by payment of the unpaid taxes, or entry into an installment payment agreement, or establishing the existence of a current Þnancial hardship as deÞned in paragraph (3) of subdivision (h), the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, shall mail a release form to the applicant or licensee and provide a release to the appropriate state governmental licensing entity. Any state governmental licensing entity that has received a release from the State Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to this subdivision shall process the release within Þve business days of its receipt. If the State Board BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY  of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board determines subsequent to the issuance of a release that the licensee has not complied with their installment payment agreement, the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, shall notify the state governmental licensing entity and the licensee in a format prescribed by the State Board of Equaliza- tion or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, that the licensee is not in compliance and the release shall be rescinded. The State Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board may, when it is economically feasible for the state governmental licensing entity to develop an automated process for complying with this subdivision, notify the state governmental licensing entity in a manner prescribed by the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, that the licensee has not complied with the installment payment agreement. Upon receipt of this notice, the state governmental licensing entity shall immediately notify the licensee on a form prescribed by the state governmental licensing entity that the licenseeÕs license will be suspended on a speciÞc date, and this date shall be no longer than 30 days from the date the form is mailed. The licensee shall be further notiÞed that the license will remain suspended until a new release is issued in accordance with this subdivision. Bus. & Prof. Code (k) The State Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board may enter into interagency agreements with the state governmental licensing entities necessary to implement this section. (l) Notwithstanding any other law, a state governmental licensing entity, with the approval of the appropriate department director or governing body, may impose a fee on a licensee whose license has been suspended pursuant to this section. The fee shall not exceed the amount necessary for the state governmental licensing entity to cover its costs in carrying out the provisions of this section. Fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the fund in which other fees imposed by the state governmental licensing entity are deposited and shall be available to that entity upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act. (m) The process described in subdivision (h) shall constitute the sole administrative remedy for contesting the issuance of a temporary license or the denial or suspension of a license under this section. (n) Any state governmental licensing entity receiving an inquiry as to the licensed status of an applicant or licensee who has had a license denied or suspended under this section or who has been granted a temporary license under this section shall respond that the license was denied or suspended or the temporary license was issued only because the licensee appeared on a list of the 500 largest tax delinquencies pursuant to Section 7063 or 19195 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Information collected pursuant to this section by any state agency, board, or department shall be subject to the Information Practices Act of 1977 (Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1798) of Title 1.8 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code). Any state governmental licensing entity that discloses on its internet website or other publication that the licensee has BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE  had a license denied or suspended under this section or has been granted a temporary license under this section shall prominently disclose, in bold and adjacent to the information regarding the status of the license, that the only reason the license was denied, suspended, or temporarily issued is because the licensee failed to pay taxes. Bus. & Prof. Code (o) Any rules and regulations issued pursuant to this section by any state agency, board, or department may be adopted as emergency regulations in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code). The adoption of these regulations shall be deemed an emergency and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, or general welfare. The regulations shall become effective immediately upon Þling with the Secretary of State. (p) The State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and state governmental licensing entities, as appropriate, shall adopt regulations as necessary to implement this section. (q)(1) Neither the state governmental licensing entity, nor any officer, employee, or agent, or former officer, employee, or agent of a state govern- mental licensing entity, may disclose or use any information obtained from the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, pursuant to this section, except to inform the public of the denial, refusal to renew, or suspension of a license or the issuance of a temporary license pursuant to this section. The release or other use of information received by a state governmental licensing entity pursuant to this section, except as authorized by this section, is punishable as a misdemeanor. This subdivision may not be interpreted to prevent the State Bar of California from Þling a request with the Supreme Court of California to suspend a member of the bar pursuant to this section. (2) A suspension of, or refusal to renew, a license or issuance of a temporary license pursuant to this section does not constitute denial or discipline of a licensee for purposes of any reporting requirements to the National Practitioner Data Bank and shall not be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank or the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. (3) Upon release from the certiÞed list, the suspension or revocation of the applicantÕs or licenseeÕs license shall be purged from the state governmental licensing entityÕs internet website or other publication within three business days. This paragraph shall not apply to the State Bar of California. (r) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable. (s) All rights to review afforded by this section to an applicant shall also be afforded to a licensee. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY  (t) Unless otherwise provided in this section, the policies, practices, and procedures of a state governmental licensing entity with respect to license suspensions under this section shall be the same as those applicable with respect to suspensions pursuant to Section 17520 of the Family Code. (u) No provision of this section shall be interpreted to allow a court to review and prevent the collection of taxes prior to the payment of those taxes in violation of the California Constitution. Bus. & Prof. Code (v) This section shall apply to any licensee whose name appears on a list of the 500 largest tax delinquencies pursuant to Section 7063 or 19195 of the Revenue and Taxation Code on or after July 1, 2012.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2011 ch 455 ¤ 3 (AB 1424), effective January 1, 2012.

Supervised Professional Experience. This section applies to all trainees, pre-or post-doctoral, who intend for hours of supervised professional experience (SPE) to count toward meeting the licensing requirement stated in section 2914(c) of the Business and Professions Code. Those trainees accruing hours of supervised experience in areas of psychology that do not include direct mental health services should refer to section 1387.3 for information on establishing an alternate plan for SPE. SPE is defined as an organized program that consists of a planned, structured and administered sequence of professionally supervised comprehensive clinical training experiences. SPE shall have a logical training sequence that builds upon the skills and competencies of trainees to prepare them for the independent practice of psychology once they become licensed. SPE shall include socialization into the profession of psychology and shall be augmented by integrated modalities including mentoring, didactic exposure, role-modeling, enactment, observational/ vicarious learning, and consultative guidance. Regulations SPE shall include activities which address the integration of psychological concepts and current and evolving scientific knowledge, principles, and theories to the professional delivery of psychological services to the consumer public. SPE shall include only the time spent by the trainee engaged in psychological activities that directly serve to prepare the trainee for the independent practice of psychology once licensed. SPE shall not include custodial tasks such as filing, transcribing or other clerical duties. The term ÒtraineeÕÕ as used in these regulations means a psychology trainee working under one of the conditions listed in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. (a) Pursuant to section 2914(c) of the code, two years of qualifying SPE shall be completed and documented prior to licensure. One year of SPE shall be defined as 1500 hours. At least one year of SPE shall be completed postdoctorally. Each year of SPE shall be completed within a thirty (30) consecutive month period. If both years of SPE (3000 hours) are completed postdoctorally, they shall be completed within a sixty (60) month period. Upon showing of good cause as determined by the board, these specified time limitations may be reasonably modified. (1) Predoctoral SPE: Up to 1500 hours of SPE may be accrued predoctorally but only after completion of 48 semester/trimester or 72 quarter units of graduate coursework in psychology not including thesis, internship or dissertation. Predoctoral SPE may be accrued only as follows: (A) In a formal internship placement pursuant to section 2911 of the code, which is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), or which is a member of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) or the California Psychology Internship Council (CAPIC) and registration with the board is not required. A formal internship placement that actually began prior to January 1, 2007 that meets the membership requirements of, but is not a member of, APPIC or CAPIC will satisfy the requirements of this section; or (B) As an employee of an exempt setting pursuant to section 2910 of the code and registration with the board is not required; or CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS  (C) As a registered psychological associate pursuant to section 2913 of the code and registration with the board prior to commencing work is required; or (D) Pursuant to a Department of Mental Health Waiver (5751.2 Welfare and Institutions Code) for which registration with the board is not required. (2) Postdoctoral SPE: At least 1500 hours of SPE shall be accrued postdoctorally. "Postdoctorally"" means after the date certified as "meeting all the requirements for the doctoral degree"" by the Registrar or Dean of the educational institution, or by the Director of Training of the doctoral program. Postdoctoral SPE may be accrued only as follows: (A) For postdoctoral SPE accrued on or after January 1, 2006, in a formal postdoctoral training program pursuant to section 2911 of the code, which is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), or which is a member of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) or the California Psychology Internship Council (CAPIC) and registration with the board is not required; or (B) As a registered psychologist pursuant to section 2909(d) of the code and registration with the board prior to commencing work is required; or (C) As an employee of an exempt setting pursuant to section 2910 of the code and registration with the board is not required; or (D) As a registered psychological associate pursuant to section 2913 of the code and registration with the board prior to commencing work is required; or (E) Pursuant to a Department of Mental Health Waiver (5751.2 Welfare and Institutions Code) for which registration with the board is not required. (b) Supervision Requirements: (1) Primary supervisors shall meet the requirements set forth in section 1387.1. (2) Delegated supervisors shall meet the requirements set forth in section 1387.2. (3) Trainees shall have no proprietary interest in the business of the primary or delegated supervisor(s) and shall not serve in any capacity which would hold influence over the primary or delegated supervisor(s)" judgment in providing supervision. (4) Trainees shall be provided with supervision for 10% of the total time worked each week. At least one hour per week shall be face-to-face, direct, individual supervision with the primary supervisor. (5) A maximum of forty four (44) hours per week will be credited toward meeting the SPE requirement. This shall include the required 10% supervision. (6) The primary supervisor shall be employed by the same work setting as the trainee and be available to the trainee 100% of the time the trainee is accruing SPE. This availability may be in-person, by telephone, by pager or by other appropriate technology. (7) Primary supervisors shall ensure that a plan is in place to protect the patient/client in the event a patient/client crisis or emergency occurs during any time the supervisor is not physically present at the established site at which the trainee is working. The primary supervisor shall ensure that the trainee thoroughly understands the plan in the event of a crisis/emergency. Regulations BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY  (8) SPE shall not be obtained from supervisors who have received payment, monetary or otherwise, from the trainee for the purpose of providing such supervision. (9) SPE gained while the trainee is functioning under another mental health license shall not be credited toward meeting the requirements for the psychologistÕs license. (10) Prior to the start of the experience, the primary supervisor and the supervisee shall together prepare an agreement that outlines the structure and sequence of the planned program of supervision to accomplish the goals and objectives of the experience. Hours accrued prior to preparing such an agreement results in those hours not counting toward the licensure requirements. The original agreement shall accompany the application for registration, if any, and identify at least the following:: ¥ Name, license number and signature of primary supervisor; ¥ Name and signature of supervisee; ¥ Statutory authority under which the supervisee will function; ¥ Start date of the experience and the anticipated completion date; ¥ Duties to be performed in a sequential structured plan as defined in this section; ¥ Address of the locations at which the duties will be performed; ¥ Goals and objectives of the plan for SPE, including how socialization into the profession will be achieved; and ¥ How and when the supervisor will provide periodic assessments and feedback to the supervisee as to whether or not he or she is performing as expected. Regulations Additionally, the agreement shall reflect that both supervisor and supervisee have discussed and understand each term of SPE as required by the California Code of Regulations. (11) Once the SPE outlined in the agreement has been completed, the primary supervisor shall submit to the supervisee both the agreement, unless previously submitted to the Board pursuant to Section 1387(b)(10), and a verification of experience form signed by the primary supervisor under penalty of perjury, in a sealed envelope, signed across the seal for submission to the Board by the supervisee along with his or her application. The verification shall certify to completion of the hours consistent with the terms of the agreement. The supervisor must indicate, in his or her best professional judgment, whether the supervisee demonstrated an overall performance at or above the level of competence expected for the supervisee"s level of education, training and experience. When SPE is accrued in a formal pre- doctoral internship or postdoctoral training program, the programÕs training director shall be authorized to perform the verification and rating duties of the primary supervisor provided that the internship training director is a licensed psychologist who possesses a valid, active license free of any disciplinary action. If the SPE is not consistent with the terms of the agreement, or if the supervisee did not demonstrate an overall performance at or above the level of competence expected for the supervisee"s level of education, training and CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS  experience, then the hours accrued will not count toward the licensure re- quirements. (c) Delegated Supervision Requirements: (1) Except as provided in section 1391.5, which regulates the supervision of registered psychological associates, primary supervisors may delegate supervision to other qualified psychologists or to other qualified mental health professionals including licensed marriage and family therapists, licensed educational psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and board certified psychiatrists. (2) The primary supervisor remains responsible for providing the minimum one hour per week of direct, individual face-to-face supervision. (3) The primary supervisor remains responsible for ensuring compliance with this section. NOTE: Authority cited: Section 2930, Business and Professions Code.

Interim order suspending permittee or imposing restric- tions (a) The Department of Justice, or an administrative law judge sitting alone as provided in subdivision (h), may upon petition issue an interim order suspending any permittee or imposing permit restrictions. The petition shall HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE Misc.  include affidavits that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, both of the following: (1) The permittee has engaged in acts or omissions constituting a viola- tion of this code or has been convicted of a crime substantially related to the permitted activity. (2) Permitting the permittee to operate, or to continue to operate without restrictions, would endanger the public health, safety, or welfare. (b) No interim order provided for in this section shall be issued without notice to the permittee, unless it appears from the petition and supporting documents that serious injury would result to the public before the matter could be heard on notice. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (b), the permittee shall be given at least 15 daysÕ notice of the hearing on the petition for an interim order. The notice shall include documents submitted to the department in support of the petition. If the order was initially issued without notice as provided in subdivision (b), the permittee shall be entitled to a hearing on the petition within 20 days of the issuance of the interim order without notice. The permittee shall be given notice of the hearing within two days after issuance of the initial interim order, and shall receive all documents in support of the petition. The failure of the department to provide a hearing within 20 days following issuance of the interim order without notice, unless the permittee waives his or her right to the hearing, shall result in the dissolution of the interim order by operation of law. (d) At the hearing on the petition for an interim order, the permittee may do the following: (1) Be represented by counsel. (2) Have a record made of the proceedings, copies of which shall be available to the permittee upon payment of costs computed in accordance with the provisions for transcript costs for judicial review contained in Section 11523 of the Government Code. (3) Present affidavits and other documentary evidence. (4) Present oral argument. (e) The department, or an administrative law judge sitting alone as pro- vided in subdivision (h), shall issue a decision on the petition for interim order within Þve business days following submission of the matter. The standard of proof required to obtain an interim order pursuant to this section shall be a preponderance of the evidence standard. If the interim order was previously issued without notice, the department shall determine whether the order shall remain in effect, be dissolved, or be modiÞed. (f) The department shall Þle an accusation within 15 days of the issuance of an interim order. In the case of an interim order issued without notice, the time shall run from the date of the order issued after the noticed hearing. If the permittee Þles a notice of defense, the hearing shall be held within 30 days of the agencyÕs receipt of the notice of defense. A decision shall be rendered on the accusation no later than 30 days after submission of the matter. Failure to BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  comply with any of the requirements in this subdivision shall dissolve the interim order by operation of law. (g) Interim orders shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and shall be heard only in the superior court in and for the County of Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego. The review of an interim order shall be limited to a determination of whether the department abused its discretion in the issuance of the interim order. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent department has not proceeded in the manner required by law, or if the court determines that the interim order is not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. (h) The department may, in its sole discretion, delegate the hearing on any petition for an interim order to an administrative law judge in the Office of Administrative Hearings. If the department hears the noticed petition itself, an administrative law judge shall preside at the hearing, rule on the admission and exclusion of evidence, and advise the department on matters of law. The department shall exercise all other powers relating to the conduct of the hearing, but may delegate any or all of them to the administrative law judge. When the petition has been delegated to an administrative law judge, he or she shall sit alone and exercise all of the powers of the department relating to the conduct of the hearing. A decision issued by an administrative law judge sitting alone shall be Þnal when it is Þled with the department. If the administrative law judge issues an interim order without notice, he or she shall preside at the noticed hearing, unless unavailable, in which case another administrative law judge may hear the matter. The decision of the administrative law judge sitting alone on the petition for an interim order is Þnal, subject only to judicial review in accordance with subdivision (g). (i)(1) Failure to comply with an interim order issued pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) shall constitute a separate cause for disciplinary action against any permittee, and may be heard at, and as a part of, the noticed hearing provided for in subdivision (f). Allegations of noncompliance with the interim order may be Þled at any time prior to the rendering of a decision on the accusation. Violation of the interim order is established upon proof that the permittee was on notice of the interim order and its terms, and that the order was in effect at the time of the violation. The Þnding of a violation of an interim order made at the hearing on the accusation shall be reviewed as a part of any review of a Þnal decision of the department. (2) If the interim order issued by the department provides for anything less than a complete suspension of the permittee and the permittee violates the interim order prior to the hearing on the accusation provided for in subdivision (f), the department may, upon notice to the permittee and proof of violation, modify or expand the interim order. (j) A plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section. A certiÞed record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE Misc.  conviction occurred. The department may take action under this section notwithstanding the fact that an appeal of the conviction may be taken. (k) The interim orders provided for by this section shall be in addition to, and not a limitation on, the authority to seek injunctive relief provided in any other provision of law.  HISTORY: Added Stats 1997 ch 397 ¤ 5 (AB 1173).

Issuance to permittee of citation for abatement or admin- istrative Þne; Provisions of citation system; Hearing; Informal con- ference; Disciplinary action on failure to comply; Citation and criminal action mutually exclusive (a) The Department of Justice may establish, by regulation, a system for the issuance to a permittee of a citation which may contain an order of abatement or an order to pay an administrative Þne assessed by the Department of Justice, if the permittee is in violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted by the Department of Justice pursuant to this chapter. (b) The system shall contain the following provisions: (1) Citations shall be in writing and shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation, including speciÞc reference to the provision of law or regulation of the department determined to have been violated. (2) Whenever appropriate, the citation shall contain an order of abate- ment Þxing a reasonable time for abatement of the violation. (3) In no event shall the administrative Þne assessed by the department exceed two thousand Þve hundred dollars ($2,500) for each violation. In assessing a Þne, due consideration shall be given to the appropriateness of the amount of the Þne with respect to such factors as the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the permittee, and the history of previous violations. (4) An order of abatement or a Þne assessment issued pursuant to a citation shall inform the permittee that if the permittee desires a hearing to contest the Þnding of a violation, that hearing shall be requested by written notice to the department within 30 days of the date of issuance of the citation or assessment. Hearings shall be held pursuant to Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. (5) In addition to requesting a hearing, the permittee may, within 10 days after service of the citation, request in writing an opportunity for an informal conference with the department regarding the citation. At the conclusion of the informal conference, the department may affirm, modify, or dismiss the citation, including any Þne levied or order of abatement issued. The decision shall be deemed to be a Þnal order with regard to the citation issued, including the Þne levied and the order of abatement. However, the permittee does not waive its right to request a hearing to contest a citation by BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  requesting an informal conference. If the citation is dismissed after the informal conference, the request for a hearing on the matter of the citation shall be deemed to be withdrawn. If the citation, including any Þne levied or order of abatement, is modiÞed, the citation originally issued shall be considered withdrawn and a new citation issued. If a hearing is requested for a subsequent citation, it shall be requested within 30 days of service of that subsequent citation. (6) Failure of a permittee to pay a Þne within 30 days of the date of assessment or comply with an order of abatement within the Þxed time, unless the citation is being appealed, may result in disciplinary action being taken by the department. If a citation is not contested and a Þne is not paid, the full amount of the assessed Þne shall be added to the renewal of the permit. A permit shall not be renewed without payment of the renewal fee and Þne. (c) The system may contain the following provisions: (1) A citation may be issued without the assessment of an administrative Þne. (2) Assessment of administrative Þnes may be limited to only particular violations of the law or department regulations. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a Þne is paid to satisfy an assessment based on the Þnding of a violation, payment of the Þne shall be represented as satisfactory resolution of the matter for purposes of public disclosure. (e) Administrative Þnes collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the General Fund. (f) The sanctions authorized under this section shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other administrative, civil, or criminal remedies; however, a criminal action may not be initiated for a speciÞc offense if a citation has been issued pursuant to this section for that offense, and a citation may not be issued pursuant to this section for a speciÞc offense if a criminal action for that offense has been Þled. (g) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the department from serving and prosecuting an accusation to suspend or revoke a permit if grounds for that suspension or revocation exist.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2003 ch 142 ¤ 1 (AB 709).  ¤ 11107.

The decision shall be deemed to be a Þnal order with regard to the citation issued, including the Þne levied or the order of abatement which could include permanent suspension to the system, a monetary Þne, or both, depending on the gravity of the violation. However, the subscriber does not waive its right to request a hearing to contest a citation by requesting an informal conference. If the citation is affirmed, a formal hearing may be requested within 30 days of the date the citation was affirmed. If the citation is dismissed after the informal conference, the request for a hearing on the matter of the citation shall be deemed to be withdrawn. If the citation, including any Þne levied or order of abatement, is modiÞed, the citation originally issued shall be considered withdrawn and a new citation issued. If a hearing is requested for a subsequent citation, it shall be requested within 30 days of service of that subsequent citation. (6) Failure of a subscriber to pay a Þne within 30 days of the date of assessment or comply with an order of abatement within the Þxed time, unless the citation is being appealed, may result in disciplinary action taken by the department.

Cannabis Research Program (a)(1) It is the intent of the Legislature that the state commission objective scientiÞc research by the premier research institute of the world, the University of California, regarding the efficacy and safety of administering cannabis, its naturally occurring constituents, and synthetic compounds, as part of medical treatment. If the Regents of the University of California, by appropriate resolution, accept this responsibility, the University of Califor- nia shall create a program, to be known as the California Cannabis Research Program, hosted by the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research. Whenever ÒCalifornia Marijuana Research ProgramÓ appears in any statute, regula- tion, or contract, or in any other code, it shall be construed to refer to the California Cannabis Research Program. (2) The program shall develop and conduct studies intended to ascertain the general medical safety and efficacy of cannabis and, if found valuable, shall develop medical guidelines for the appropriate administration and use of cannabis. The studies may examine the effect of cannabis on motor skills, BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  the health and safety effects of cannabis, cannabinoids, and other related constituents, and other behavioral and health outcomes. (b) The program may immediately solicit proposals for research projects to be included in the cannabis studies. Program requirements to be used when evaluating responses to its solicitation for proposals shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following: (1) Proposals shall demonstrate the use of key personnel, including clinicians or scientists and support personnel, who are prepared to develop a program of research regarding the general medical efficacy and safety of cannabis. (2) Proposals shall contain procedures for outreach to patients with various medical conditions who may be suitable participants in research on cannabis. (3) Proposals shall contain provisions for a patient registry. (4) Proposals shall contain provisions for an information system that is designed to record information about possible study participants, investiga- tors, and clinicians, and deposit and analyze data that accrues as part of clinical trials. (5) Proposals shall contain protocols suitable for research on cannabis, addressing patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeÞciency syndrome (AIDS) or human immunodeÞciency virus (HIV), cancer, glaucoma, or seizures or muscle spasms associated with a chronic, debilitating condition. The proposal may also include research on other serious illnesses, provided that resources are available and medical information justiÞes the research. (6) Proposals shall demonstrate the use of a specimen laboratory capable of housing plasma, urine, and other specimens necessary to study the concentration of cannabinoids in various tissues, as well as housing speci- mens for studies of toxic effects of cannabis. (7) Proposals shall demonstrate the use of a laboratory capable of analyz- ing cannabis, provided to the program under this section, for purity and cannabinoid content and the capacity to detect contaminants. (c) In order to ensure objectivity in evaluating proposals, the program shall use a peer review process that is modeled on the process used by the National Institutes of Health, and that guards against funding research that is biased in favor of or against particular outcomes. Peer reviewers shall be selected for their expertise in the scientiÞc substance and methods of the proposed research, and their lack of bias or conßict of interest regarding the applicants or the topic of an approach taken in the proposed research. Peer reviewers shall judge research proposals on several criteria, foremost among which shall be both of the following: (1) The scientiÞc merit of the research plan, including whether the research design and experimental procedures are potentially biased for or against a particular outcome. (2) ResearchersÕ expertise in the scientiÞc substance and methods of the proposed research, and their lack of bias or conßict of interest regarding the topic of, and the approach taken in, the proposed research. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE Misc.  (d) If the program is administered by the Regents of the University of California, any grant research proposals approved by the program shall also require review and approval by the research advisory panel. (e) It is the intent of the Legislature that the program be established as follows: (1) The program shall be located at one or more University of California campuses that have a core of faculty experienced in organizing multidisci- plinary scientiÞc endeavors and, in particular, strong experience in clinical trials involving psychopharmacologic agents.

Legislative Þndings and declarations The Legislature Þnds and declares that the laws of this state which prohibit the possession, possession for sale, offer for sale, sale, manufacturing, and transportation of controlled substances are being circumvented by the com- mission of those acts with respect to analogs of speciÞed controlled substances which have, are represented to have, or are intended to have effects on the central nervous system which are substantially similar to, or greater than, the controlled substances classiÞed in Sections 11054 and 11055 and the synthetic cannabinoid compounds deÞned in Section 11357.5, of which they are analogs. These analogs have been synthesized by so-called Òstreet chemistsÓ and imported into this state from other jurisdictions as precursors to, or substitutes for, controlled substances and synthetic cannabinoid compounds, due to the nonexistence of applicable criminal penalties. These analogs present grave dangers to the health and safety of the people of this state. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, as deÞned in Section 11401, be considered identical, for purposes of the penalties and punishment speciÞed in Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 11350), to the controlled substance in Section 11054 or 11055 or the synthetic cannabinoid compound deÞned in Section 11357.5 of which it is an analog.  HISTORY: Added Stats 1988 ch 712 ¤ 4, effective August 29, 1988.

A certifying physician shall have demonstrated competency and understanding of the then applicable guide- lines or standards of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. (d) ÒCommunicable diseaseÓ means any disease that was transferable through the exposure incident, as determined by the certifying physician. (e) ÒExposed individualÓ means any individual health care provider, Þrst responder, or any other person, including, but not limited to, any employee, volunteer, or contracted agent of any health care provider, who is exposed, within the scope of his or her employment, to the blood or other potentially infectious materials of a source patient. (f) ÒHealth care providerÓ means any person licensed or certiÞed pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code, any person licensed pursuant to the Osteopathic Initiative Act or the Chiropractic Initiative Act, any person certiÞed pursuant to Division 2.5 BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (commencing with Section 1797), any clinic, health dispensary, or health facility licensed or exempt from licensure pursuant to Division 2 (commenc- ing with Section 1200), any employee, volunteer, or contracted agent of any group practice prepayment health care service plan regulated pursuant to the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Chapter 2.2 (com- mencing with Section 1340) of Division 2), and any professional student of one of the clinics, health dispensaries, or health care facilities or health care providers described in this subdivision. (g) ÒFirst responderÓ means a police officer, ÞreÞghter, rescue worker, or any other person who provides emergency response, Þrst aid care, or other medically related assistance either in the course of the personÕs occupational duties or as a volunteer. (h) ÒOther potentially infectious materialsÓ means those body ßuids identiÞed by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health as potentially capable of transmitting a communicable disease. (i) ÒSigniÞcant exposureÓ means direct contact with blood or other poten- tially infectious materials of a patient in a manner that, according to the then applicable guidelines of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, is capable of transmitting a communicable disease. (j) ÒSource patientÓ means any person receiving health care services whose blood or other potentially infectious material has been the source of a signiÞcant exposure to an exposed individual.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2002 ch 342 ¤ 1 (AB 2423).  ¤ 120262. Testing of source patient; NotiÞcation to exposed indi- vidual Notwithstanding Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 120975) or any other law, the blood or other tissue or material of a source patient may be tested, and an exposed individual may be informed whether the patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease if the exposed individual and the health care facility, if any, have substantially complied with the then appli- cable guidelines of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health and the State Department of Health Services and if the following procedure is followed: (a)(1) If a person becomes an exposed individual by experiencing an exposure to the blood or other potentially infectious material of a patient during the course of rendering health care-related services or occupational services, the exposed individual may request an evaluation of the exposure by a physician to determine if it is a signiÞcant exposure, as deÞned in subdivision (h) of Section 120261. A physician or other exposed individual shall not certify his or her own signiÞcant exposure. However, an employ- ing physician may certify the exposure of one of his or her employees. Requests for certiÞcation shall be made in writing within 72 hours of the exposure. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE Misc.  (2) A written certiÞcation by a physician of the signiÞcance of the exposure shall be obtained within 72 hours of the request. The certiÞcation shall include the nature and extent of the exposure. (b)(1) The exposed individual shall be counseled regarding the likelihood of transmission, the limitations of the testing performed, the need for followup testing, and the procedures that the exposed individual must follow regardless of whether the source patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease. The exposed individual may be tested in accordance with the then applicable guidelines or standards of the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The result of this test shall be conÞrmed as negative before available blood or other patient samples of the source patient may be tested for evidence of infection to a communicable disease, without the consent of the source patient pursuant to subdivision (d). (2) Within 72 hours of certifying the exposure as signiÞcant, the certifying physician shall provide written certiÞcation to an attending physician of the source patient that a signiÞcant exposure to an exposed individual has occurred, and shall request information on whether the source patient has tested positive or negative for a communicable disease, and the availability of blood or other patient samples. An attending physician shall respond to the request for information within three working days. (c) If test results of the source patient are already known to be positive for a communicable disease then, except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 121010, when the exposed individual is a health care provider or an employee or agent of the health care provider of the source patient, an attending physician and surgeon of the source patient shall attempt to obtain the consent of the source patient to disclose to the exposed individual the testing results of the source patient regarding communicable diseases. If the source patient cannot be contacted or refuses to consent to the disclosure, then the exposed individual may be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases of the source patient by an attending physician of the source patient as soon as possible after the exposure has been certiÞed as signiÞcant, notwithstanding Section 120980 or any other law. (d) If the communicable disease status of the source patient is unknown to the certifying physician or an attending physician, if blood or other patient samples are available, and if the exposed individual has tested negative on a baseline test for communicable diseases, the source patient shall be given the opportunity to give informed consent to a test for communicable diseases in accordance with the following: (1) Within 72 hours after receiving a written certiÞcation of signiÞcant exposure, an attending physician of the source patient shall do all of the following: (A) Make a good faith effort to notify the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient about the signiÞ- BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  cant exposure. A good faith effort to notify includes, but is not limited to, a documented attempt to locate the source patient by telephone or by Þrst-class mail with a certiÞcate of mailing. An attempt to locate the source patient and the results of that attempt shall be documented in the medical record of the source patient. An inability to contact the source patient, or legal representative of the source patient, after a good faith effort to do so as provided in this subdivision, shall constitute a refusal of consent pursuant to paragraph (2). An inability of the source patient to provide informed consent shall constitute a refusal of consent pursuant to paragraph (2), provided all of the following conditions are met: (i) The source patient has no authorized legal representative. (ii) The source patient is incapable of giving consent. (iii) In the opinion of the attending physician, it is likely that the source patient will be unable to grant informed consent within the 72-hour period during which the physician is required to respond pursuant to paragraph (1). (B) Attempt to obtain the voluntary informed consent of the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient to perform a test for a communicable disease, on the source patient or on any available blood or patient sample of the source patient. The voluntary informed consent shall be in writing. The source patient shall have the option not to be informed of the test result. An exposed individual shall be prohibited from attempting to obtain directly in- formed consent for testing for communicable diseases from the source patient. (C) Provide the source patient with medically appropriate pretest counseling and refer the source patient to appropriate posttest counsel- ing and followup, if necessary. The source patient shall be offered medically appropriate counseling whether or not he or she consents to testing. (2) If the source patient or the authorized legal representative of the source patient refuses to consent to test for a communicable disease after a documented effort has been made to obtain consent, any available blood or patient sample of the source patient may be tested. The source patient or authorized legal representative of the source patient shall be informed that an available blood sample or other tissue or material will be tested despite his or her refusal, and that the exposed individual shall be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases. (3) If the informed consent of the source patient cannot be obtained because the source patient is deceased, consent to perform a test for a communicable disease on any blood or patient sample of the source patient legally obtained in the course of providing health care services at the time of the exposure event shall be deemed granted. (4) A source patient or the authorized legal representative of a source patient shall be advised that he or she shall be informed of the results of HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE Misc.  the test for communicable diseases only if he or she wishes to be so informed. If a patient refuses to provide informed consent to testing for communicable diseases and refuses to learn the results of the testing, he or she shall sign a form documenting this refusal. The source patientÕs refusal to sign this form shall be construed to be a refusal to be informed of the test results regarding communicable diseases. Test results for communicable diseases shall only be placed in the medical record when the patient has agreed in writing to be informed of the results. (5) Notwithstanding any other law, if the source patient or authorized legal representative of a source patient refuses to be informed of the results of the test, the test results regarding communicable diseases of that source patient shall only be provided to the exposed individual in accordance with the then applicable regulations established by the Divi- sion of Occupational Safety and Health. (6) The source patientÕs identity shall be encoded on the communicable disease test result record. (e) If an exposed individual is informed of the status of a source patient with regard to a communicable disease pursuant to this section, the exposed individual shall be informed that he or she is subject to existing conÞdenti- ality protections for any identifying information about the communicable disease test results, and that medical information regarding the communi- cable disease status of the source patient shall be kept conÞdential and may not be further disclosed, except as otherwise authorized by law. The exposed individual shall be informed of the penalties for which he or she would be personally liable for violation of Section 120980. (f) The costs for the test and counseling for communicable diseases of the exposed individual, or the source patient, or both, shall be borne by the employer of the exposed individual, if any. An employer who directs and controls the exposed individual shall provide the postexposure evaluation and followup required by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health as well as the testing and counseling for source patients required under this chapter. If an exposed individual is a volunteer or a student, then the health care provider or Þrst responder that assigned a task to the volunteer or student may pay for the costs of testing and counseling as if that volunteer or student were an employee. If an exposed individual, who is not an employee of a health facility or of another health care provider, chooses to obtain postexposure evaluation or followup counseling, or both, or treat- ment, he or she shall be Þnancially responsible for the costs thereof and shall be responsible for the costs of the testing and counseling for the source patient. (g) This section does not authorize the disclosure of the source patientÕs identity. (h) This section does not authorize a health care provider to draw blood or other body ßuids except as otherwise authorized by law. (i) The provisions of this section are cumulative only and shall not BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  preclude testing of source patients for a communicable disease, as autho- rized by any other law. (j) Except as otherwise provided under this section, all conÞdentiality requirements regarding medical records that are provided for under existing law apply to this section.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2002 ch 342 ¤ 1 (AB 2423).

If the health care provider chooses to prepare a summary of the record rather than allowing access to the entire record, he or she shall make the summary of the record available to the patient within 10 working days from the date of the patientÕs request. However, if more time is needed because the record is of extraordinary length or because the patient was discharged from a licensed health facility within the last 10 days, the health care provider shall notify the patient of this fact and the date that the summary will be completed, but in no case shall more than 30 days elapse between the request by the patient and the delivery of the summary.

When an agency takes a report about a case of suspected child abuse or neglect in which that agency lacks jurisdiction, the agency shall immediately refer the case by telephone, fax, or electronic transmission to an agency with proper jurisdiction. Agencies that are required to receive reports of suspected child abuse or neglect may not refuse to accept a report of suspected child abuse or neglect from a mandated reporter or another person unless otherwise authorized pursuant to this section, and shall maintain a record of all reports received.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2000 ch 916 ¤ 8 (AB 1241).

Duty to report; Mandated reporters; Punishment for viola- tion (a) Except as provided in subdivision (d), and in Section 11166.05, a mandated reporter shall make a report to an agency speciÞed in Section 11165.9 whenever the mandated reporter, in the mandated reporterÕs profes- sional capacity or within the scope of the mandated reporterÕs employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. The mandated reporter shall make an initial report by telephone to the agency immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, and shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident. The mandated reporter may include with the report any nonprivileged documentary evidence the man- dated reporter possesses relating to the incident. (1) For purposes of this article, Òreasonable suspicionÓ means that it is objectively reasonable for a person to entertain a suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a like position, drawing, when appropriate, on the personÕs training and experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect. ÒReasonable suspicionÓ does not require certainty that child abuse or neglect has occurred nor does it require a speciÞc medical indication of child abuse or neglect; any Òreasonable suspicionÓ is sufficient. For purposes of this article, the pregnancy of a minor does not, in and of itself, constitute a basis for a reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse. (2) The agency shall be notiÞed, and a report shall be prepared and sent by fax or electronic transmission, even if the child has expired, regardless of whether or not the possible abuse was a factor contributing to the death, and even if suspected child abuse was discovered during an autopsy. (3) A report made by a mandated reporter pursuant to this section shall be known as a mandated report. (b) If, after reasonable efforts, a mandated reporter is unable to submit an initial report by telephone, the mandated reporter shall immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, by fax or electronic transmission, make a one-time automated written report on the form prescribed by the Department of Justice, and shall also be available to respond to a telephone followup call by the agency with which the mandated reporter Þled the report. A mandated reporter who Þles a one-time automated written report because the mandated reporter was PENAL CODE Misc.  unable to submit an initial report by telephone is not required to submit a written followup report. (1) The one-time automated written report form prescribed by the Depart- ment of Justice shall be clearly identiÞable so that it is not mistaken for a standard written followup report. In addition, the automated one-time report shall contain a section that allows the mandated reporter to state the reason the initial telephone call was not able to be completed. The reason for the submission of the one-time automated written report in lieu of the procedure prescribed in subdivision (a) shall be captured in the statewide child welfare information system. The department shall work with stake- holders to modify reporting forms and the statewide child welfare informa- tion system as is necessary to accommodate the changes enacted by these provisions. (2) This subdivision shall not become operative until the statewide child welfare information system is updated to capture the information prescribed in this subdivision. (3) This subdivision shall become inoperative three years after this subdivision becomes operative or on January 1, 2009, whichever occurs Þrst. (4) This section does not supersede the requirement that a mandated reporter Þrst attempt to make a report via telephone, or that agencies speciÞed in Section 11165.9 accept reports from mandated reporters and other persons as required. (c) A mandated reporter who fails to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect as required by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months conÞnement in a county jail or by a Þne of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by both that imprisonment and Þne. If a mandated reporter intentionally conceals the mandated reporterÕs failure to report an incident known by the mandated reporter to be abuse or severe neglect under this section, the failure to report is a continuing offense until an agency speciÞed in Section 11165.9 discovers the offense. (d)(1) A clergy member who acquires knowledge or a reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect during a penitential communication is not subject to subdivision (a). For the purposes of this subdivision, Òpenitential communi- cationÓ means a communication, intended to be in conÞdence, including, but not limited to, a sacramental confession, made to a clergy member who, in the course of the discipline or practice of the clergy memberÕs church, denomination, or organization, is authorized or accustomed to hear those communications, and under the discipline, tenets, customs, or practices of the clergy memberÕs church, denomination, or organization, has a duty to keep those communications secret. (2) This subdivision does not modify or limit a clergy memberÕs duty to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect when the clergy member is acting in some other capacity that would otherwise make the clergy member a mandated reporter. (3)(A) On or before January 1, 2004, a clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member may report to an agency speciÞed in Section BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  11165.9 that the clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member, prior to January 1, 1997, in the clergy memberÕs professional capacity or within the scope of the clergy memberÕs employment, other than during a penitential communication, acquired knowledge or had a reasonable suspicion that a child had been the victim of sexual abuse and that the clergy member or any custodian of records for the clergy member did not previously report the abuse to an agency speciÞed in Section 11165.9. The provisions of Section 11172 shall apply to all reports made pursuant to this paragraph. (B) This paragraph shall apply even if the victim of the known or suspected abuse has reached the age of majority by the time the required report is made. (C) The local law enforcement agency shall have jurisdiction to inves- tigate any report of child abuse made pursuant to this paragraph even if the report is made after the victim has reached the age of majority. (e)(1) A commercial Þlm, photographic print, or image processor who has knowledge of or observes, within the scope of that personÕs professional capacity or employment, any Þlm, photograph, videotape, negative, slide, or any representation of information, data, or an image, including, but not limited to, any Þlm, Þlmstrip, photograph, negative, slide, photocopy, video- tape, video laser disc, computer hardware, computer software, computer ßoppy disk, data storage medium, CD-ROM, computer-generated equip- ment, or computer-generated image depicting a child under 16 years of age engaged in an act of sexual conduct, shall, immediately or as soon as practicably possible, telephonically report the instance of reasonably sus- pected abuse to the law enforcement agency located in the county in which the images are seen. Within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident, the reporter shall prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report of the incident with a copy of the image or material attached. (2) A commercial computer technician who has knowledge of or observes, within the scope of the technicianÕs professional capacity or employment, any representation of information, data, or an image, including, but not limited to, any computer hardware, computer software, computer Þle, computer ßoppy disk, data storage medium, CD-ROM, computer-generated equip- ment, or computer-generated image that is retrievable in perceivable form and that is intentionally saved, transmitted, or organized on an electronic medium, depicting a child under 16 years of age engaged in an act of sexual conduct, shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, telephonically report the instance of reasonably suspected abuse to the law enforcement agency located in the county in which the images or materials are seen.

For purposes of this section, Òany other personÓ includes a mandated reporter who acts in the personÕs private capacity and not in the personÕs professional capacity or within the scope of the personÕs employment. (h) When two or more persons, who are required to report, jointly have knowledge of a known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, and when there is agreement among them, the telephone report may be made by a member of the team selected by mutual agreement and a single report may be made and signed by the selected member of the reporting team. Any member who has knowledge that the member designated to report has failed to do so shall thereafter make the report. (i)(1) The reporting duties under this section are individual, and no super- visor or administrator may impede or inhibit the reporting duties, and no person making a report shall be subject to any sanction for making the report. However, internal procedures to facilitate reporting and apprise supervisors and administrators of reports may be established provided that they are not inconsistent with this article. An internal policy shall not direct an employee to allow the employeeÕs supervisor to Þle or process a mandated report under any circumstances. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (2) The internal procedures shall not require any employee required to make reports pursuant to this article to disclose the employeeÕs identity to the employer. (3) Reporting the information regarding knowledge of or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person shall not be a substitute for making a mandated report to an agency speciÞed in Section 11165.9. (j)(1) A county probation or welfare department shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or electronic transmis- sion to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case, to the agency given the responsibility for investigation of cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and to the district attorneyÕs office every known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect, as deÞned in Section 11165.6, except acts or omissions coming within subdivi- sion (b) of Section 11165.2, or reports made pursuant to Section 11165.13 based on risk to a child that relates solely to the inability of the parent to provide the child with regular care due to the parentÕs substance abuse, which shall be reported only to the county welfare or probation department. A county probation or welfare department also shall send by fax or electronic transmission a written report thereof within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident to any agency to which it makes a telephone report under this subdivision. (2) A county probation or welfare department shall immediately, and in no case in more than 24 hours, report to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case after receiving information that a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services has been identiÞed as the victim of commercial sexual exploitation, as deÞned in subdivision (d) of Section 11165.1. (3) When a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services and who is reasonably believed to be the victim of, or is at risk of being the victim of, commercial sexual exploitation, as deÞned in Section 11165.1, is missing or has been abducted, the county probation or welfare department shall immediately, or in no case later than 24 hours from receipt of the informa- tion, report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement authority for entry into the National Crime Information Center database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. (k) A law enforcement agency shall immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, report by telephone, fax, or electronic transmission to the agency given responsibility for investigation of cases under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and to the district attorneyÕs office every known or reasonably suspected instance of child abuse or neglect reported to it, except acts or omissions coming within subdivision (b) of Section 11165.2, which shall be reported only to the county welfare or probation department.

The program may receive reports by mandated reporters, as deÞned in Section 11165.7, of suspected child abuse or neglect and shall meet all of the following conditions: (1) The suspected child abuse or neglect does not indicate that the child is subject to an immediate risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation or that the child is in imminent danger of severe harm or death. (2) The agency provides an internet form that includes standardized safety assessment qualifying questions in order to obtain necessary infor- mation required to assess the need for child welfare services and a response. The State Department of Social Services shall provide guidance through written directives to counties participating in the program to incorporate qualifying questions in the online report that would indicate the need to redirect the mandated reporter to perform a telephone report. (3) The mandated reporter is required to complete all required Þelds, including identity and contact information of the mandated reporter, in order to submit the report. (4) The agency provides an internet-based reporting system that has appropriate security protocols to preserve the conÞdentiality of the reports and any documents or photographs submitted through the system. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (5) This section does not change current statutory or regulatory require- ments regarding timely review, assessment, and response to reports of possible abuse or neglect. (b)(1) In a county where the program is active, a mandated reporter may use the internet-based reporting tool in lieu of the required initial telephone report required by subdivision (a) of Section 11166.

Any other person reporting a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect shall not incur civil or criminal liability as a result of any report authorized by this article unless it can be proven that a false report was made and the person knew that the report was false or was made with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report, and any person who makes a report of child abuse or neglect known to be false or with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report is liable for any damages caused. No person required to make a report pursuant to this article, nor any person taking photographs at their direction, shall incur any civil or criminal liability for taking photographs of a suspected victim of child abuse or neglect, or causing photographs to be taken of a suspected victim of child abuse or neglect, without parental consent, or for disseminating the photographs, images, or material with the reports required by this article.

ÒVoluntary admissionÓ for a child not within the custody of a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian refers to the childÕs decision to voluntarily admit themselves pursuant to Section 6552. ÒVoluntary admissionÓ for a nonminor dependent refers to the nonminor dependentÕs decision to voluntarily admit themselves. (b)(1) When a parent, guardian, or Indian custodian who retains physical custody of a child under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 300 seeks to have a child admitted to a psychiatric residential treatment facility or when a child who is the subject of a petition pursuant to Section 300 seeks to make a voluntary admission to a psychiatric residential treatment facility pursuant to Section 6552, the social worker shall Þle an ex parte application for an order authorizing the voluntary admission pursuant to Section 6552 within 48 hours of being informed of the request or, if the courts are closed for more than 48 hours after being informed of the request, on the Þrst judicial day after being informed of the request.

The court clerk shall immediately notify the social worker and the childÕs counsel of the date, time, and place for the hearing. (3) The social worker shall provide notice of the hearing in accordance with Title 3 of the California Rules of Court to all parties to the proceeding and their counsel of record, the childÕs tribe in the case of an Indian child, the childÕs court-appointed special advocate, if applicable, and any person designated as the childÕs educational or developmental representative pur- suant to subdivision (a) of Section 361. The provisions in subdivision (c) of Section 527 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to notice of the hearing. The social worker shall make arrangements for the child to be transported to the hearing. (c)(1) At the hearing, the court shall consider evidence in the form of oral testimony under oath, affidavit or declaration, or other admissible evidence, including a child welfare agency court report, as to all of the following: (A)(i) Whether the child suffers from a mental disorder which may reasonably be expected to be cured or ameliorated by a course of treatment offered by the psychiatric residential treatment facility in which the child wishes to be placed. (ii) Whether the psychiatric residential treatment facility is the least restrictive setting for care. (iii) Whether there any available hospital, program, or facility which might better serve the childÕs medical needs and best interest, including less restrictive facilities or community-based services. (B) Whether and how the child, parent, legal guardian, or Indian custodian, as appropriate, has been advised of the nature of inpatient psychiatric services, patientÕs rights as identiÞed in Section 6006, and their right to contact a patientsÕ rights advocate. (C) Whether and how the social worker addressed the possible volun- tary admission with the childÕs attorney, including whether the child was given the opportunity to confer privately with their attorney about a voluntary admission. (D) Whether and how the possible voluntary admission was addressed with the child and family team, whether any member of the team objects to voluntary admission, and the reasons for the objection. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (E) The county child welfare agency plan for the child, as described in Section 16010.10. (F) Whether the childÕs parent, guardian, or Indian custodian has taken reasonable steps to address the childÕs mental health disorder. (2)(A) If the childÕs parent, guardian, or Indian custodian seeks to give voluntary consent to the childÕs admission, the court shall inquire about the childÕs position on the admission. (B) If the child seeks to give voluntary consent to admission, the court shall inquire whether they knowingly and intelligently consent to admis- sion into the psychiatric residential treatment facility, including whether they are giving consent without fear or threat of detention or initiation of conservatorship proceedings. (3) The court shall not continue the hearing unless the child consents to the continuance and the court determines that additional evidence is necessary to support the Þndings required by subdivision (c). Any continu- ance shall be for only such period of time as is necessary to obtain the evidence and only if it is not detrimental to the child. (d)(1) The court may grant a request to have the child admitted, or authorize a childÕs voluntary consent to admission, into a psychiatric residential treatment facility, only if it Þnds, by clear and convincing evidence, all of the following: (A) That the child suffers from a mental disorder which may reasonably be expected to be cured or ameliorated by a course of treatment offered by the hospital, facility, or program in which the child wishes to be placed. (B) That the psychiatric residential treatment facility is the least restrictive setting needed to treat the childÕs mental disorder. (C) That there is no other available hospital, program, or facility which might better serve the childÕs medical needs and best interest, including community-based mental health services. (D) That the child has given knowing and intelligent consent to admis- sion to the facility and that the consent was not made under fear or threat of detention or initiation of conservatorship proceedings. (E) That the child and, where appropriate, the parent, legal guardian, or Indian custodian have been advised of the nature of inpatient psychi- atric services, patientÕs rights as identiÞed in Section 6006, and their right to contact a patientsÕ rights advocate. (2)(A) When authorizing a parentÕs request for admission or the childÕs voluntary consent, the court may make any orders necessary to ensure that the child welfare agency promptly makes all necessary arrangements to ensure that the child is discharged in a timely manner and with all services and supports in place as necessary for a successful transition into another setting. (B) The courtÕs order authorizing the admission to a psychiatric resi- dential treatment facility shall be effective until the Þrst of the following events occurs: (1) the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, or the child if WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE Misc.  admission was granted pursuant to Section 6552, withdraws consent for the child to be present in the psychiatric residential treatment facility, (2) the court Þnds that the child no longer suffers from a mental disorder that may reasonably expected to be ameliorated by the treatment offered by the facility or that the psychiatric residential treatment facility is no longer the least restrictive alternative for the treatment of the childÕs mental health needs, or (3) the court makes a superseding order. This section does not require a court order to discharge a child if the parent, guardian, Indian custodian, or child withdraws their consent for admission. (3) For children who were in the custody of their parent, legal guardian, or Indian custodian at the time of the authorization of admission and based on the evidence presented during the ex parte hearing, the court shall consider whether the parentÕs, legal guardianÕs, or Indian custodianÕs con- duct contributed to the deterioration of the childÕs mental disorder. If the court determines that the parentÕs, legal guardianÕs, or Indian custodianÕs conduct may have contributed to the deterioration, it shall direct the county child welfare agency to investigate whether the child may be safely returned to the custody of the parent, legal guardian, or Indian custodian upon their discharge from the psychiatric residential treatment facility and to take appropriate action, including, but not limited to, taking the child into temporary custody prior to the childÕs discharge from the facility and Þling a subsequent petition pursuant to Section 342 or a supplemental petition pursuant to Section 387. (e)(1) Whenever a nonminor dependent seeks to voluntarily consent to admission to a psychiatric residential treatment facility, the social worker shall Þle an ex parte application within 48 hours of the request, or, if the courts are closed for more than 48 hours after being informed of the request, on the Þrst judicial day after being informed of the request, for a hearing to address whether the nonminor dependent has been advised of the nature of inpatient psychiatric services, patientÕs rights as identiÞed in Section 6006, and their right to contact a patientsÕ rights advocate, and give informed voluntary consent to admission. The application shall satisfy the require- ments of Title 3 of the California Rules of Court, and include all of the following: (A) A brief description of the medical necessity for admission into a psychiatric residential treatment facility. (B) The name of the psychiatric residential treatment facility proposed for treatment. (C) A copy of the child welfare agencyÕs plan developed pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 16010.10. (D) A description of any mental health services, including community- based mental health services, that were offered or provided to the nonminor dependent and an explanation for why those services were not sufficient, or an explanation for why no such services were offered or provided. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (E) A brief description of why the nonminor dependent believes admis- sion to a less restrictive facility would not adequately address their mental disorder. (F) A statement describing how the nonminor dependent was given the opportunity to confer privately with their counsel regarding the applica- tion. (G) The information required by this paragraph shall be sufficient to satisfy the applicantÕs initial burden of establishing the need for an ex parte hearing required by subdivision (c) of Rule 3.1202 of the California Rules of Court. (2) Upon receipt of an ex parte application pursuant to paragraph (1), the juvenile court shall schedule a hearing for the next judicial day. The court clerk shall immediately notify the social worker and nonminor dependentÕs counsel of the date, time, and place for the hearing. (3) The social worker shall provide notice of the hearing in accordance with Title 3 of the California Rules of Court to all parties to the proceeding and their counsel of record, the nonminor dependentÕs tribe, if applicable, the nonminor dependentÕs court-appointed special advocate, if applicable, and any person designated as the nonminor dependentÕs educational or develop- mental representative pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 361. The provisions in subdivision (c) of Section 527 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to notice of the hearing. The social worker shall make arrange- ments for the nonminor dependent to be present for the hearing. (4) At the hearing, the court shall consider evidence in the form of oral testimony under oath, affidavit or declaration, or other admissible evidence, as to all of the following: (A) Whether the nonminor dependentÕs receipt of treatment in the psychiatric residential treatment facility is medically necessary. (B) Whether any less restrictive treatment setting could serve the nonminor dependentÕs treatment needs, including a less restrictive facility or community-based services. (C) Whether and how the nonminor dependent has been advised of the nature of inpatient psychiatric services, patientÕs rights as identiÞed in Section 6006, and their right to contact a patientsÕ rights advocate. (D) Whether and how the social worker addressed the voluntary admis- sion with the nonminor dependentÕs attorney, including whether the nonminor dependent was given the opportunity to confer privately with their attorney about a voluntary admission. (E) Whether and how the possible voluntary admission was addressed with the child and family team, whether any member of the team objects to voluntary admission, and the reasons for the objection. (F) Whether the nonminor dependent gives knowing and intelligent consent to admission. (G) The county child welfare agencyÕs plan for the nonminor dependent, as described in subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 16010.10. WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE Misc.  (5)(A) At the hearing, the court shall make a Þnding whether the nonminor dependent has given knowing and intelligent consent to admis- sion. If the court Þnds that the nonminor dependent has not given knowing and intelligent consent, it shall direct the social worker to convey its Þnding to the facility and direct the facility to discharge the nonminor dependent in accordance with the nonminor dependentÕs aftercare plan. The social worker shall ensure that the aftercare plan is implemented to ensure integration with the nonminor dependentÕs family, school, and community upon discharge. If the court Þnds that the nonminor depen- dent has given knowing and intelligent consent, nothing in this section requires a court order to discharge the nonminor if the nonminor depen- dent subsequently withdraws their consent. (B)(i) The court may make any orders necessary to ensure that the child welfare agency promptly makes all necessary arrangements to ensure that the nonminor dependent is discharged in a timely manner and with all services and supports in place as necessary for a successful transition into a less restrictive setting. (ii) The judicial proceedings described in this subdivision shall not delay a nonminor dependentÕs access to medically necessary services as deÞned in Section 14059.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and Section 1396d(r) of Title 42 of the United States Code, which may include voluntary admission to a psychiatric residential treatment facility for inpatient psychiatric services, while the judicial proceedings are ongoing. (f)(1)(A) No later than 60 days following the admission of a child to a psychiatric residential treatment facility, and every 30 days thereafter, the court shall hold a review hearing on the childÕs placement in the facility based upon the medical necessity of that placement. (B) If the hearing described in subparagraph (A) coincides with the date for a status review hearing for a child pursuant to Section 364, 366.21, 366.22, 366.25, or 366.3, the court may hold the hearing simultaneously with the status review hearing. (C) At the hearing described in subparagraph (A), the court shall consider all of the following: (i) Whether the parent, guardian, Indian custodian, or child consents, or continues to consent, to the voluntary admission made pursuant to this section. (ii) Whether the child continues to suffer from a mental disorder that may reasonably be expected to be cured or ameliorated by a course of treatment offered by the facility. (iii) Whether there continues to be no other available less restrictive hospital, program, facility, or community-based mental health service which might better serve the childÕs medical needs and best interest. (iv) Whether the psychiatric residential treatment facility, which is licensed pursuant to Section 4081, continues to meet its legal obligation to provide services to the child. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (v) The county child welfare agencyÕs plan as described in subdivi- sions (c) and (d) of Section 16010.10, and the agencyÕs actions to implement that plan. (D) If the court Þnds at any hearing that the child, if the child consented to admission pursuant to Section 6552, continues to give voluntary consent to admission, that the child continues to suffer from a mental disorder which may reasonably be expected to be cured or ameliorated by a course of treatment offered by the facility, and that there continues to be no other available less restrictive hospital, program, facility, or commu- nity-based mental health service which might better serve the childÕs medical need and best interest, the court may authorize the childÕs continued consent to admission to a psychiatric residential treatment facility. If the child has been in the facility for over 30 days, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the facility is not the least restrictive alternative to serve the childÕs medical need and best interest. (E)(i) If the court Þnds that the child, if the child consented to admission pursuant to Section 6552, no longer gives voluntary consent, that the child no longer suffers from a mental disorder which may reasonably be expected to be cured or ameliorated by a course of treatment offered by the facility, or that there is another available hospital, program, facility, or community-based mental health service which might better serve the childÕs medical need and best interest, the social worker shall work immediately with the facility for discharge to a different setting with the appropriate and necessary services and supports in place. A statement from the childÕs attorney that the child no longer gives voluntary consent to the admission to the facility may be sufficient to support a Þnding that the child no longer gives voluntary consent. The court shall set a hearing no later than 30 days to verify that the child has been discharged. If the child has not been discharged by the time of the hearing, the court shall issue any and all orders to effectuate the childÕs immediate discharge, including exercising its powers under subdivision (b) of Section 362. This paragraph does not preclude involuntary detention of the child pursuant to the applicable requirements of the ChildrenÕs Civil Com- mitment and Mental Health Treatment Act of 1988 or the Lanterman- Petris-Short Act if the child withdraws voluntary consent. This para- graph does not preclude a parent, guardian, Indian custodian, or childÕs social worker or attorney from arranging the childÕs discharge from the facility without a court order. (ii) If the courtÕs determination under clause (i) includes a determi- nation that the child should receive treatment through another hospital, program, facility, or community-based mental health service, the court shall hold a hearing no later than 60 days from the childÕs discharge to ensure that the other services have been provided. (F) If the court determines the psychiatric residential treatment facil- ity, which is licensed pursuant to Section 4081, failed to meet its legal WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE Misc.  obligation to provide services to the child, it may direct the social worker to engage with the facility to ensure the child is receiving all necessary services. If necessary, the court may exercise its powers under subdivision (b) of Section 362. (G) The court may make any orders necessary to ensure that the child welfare agency makes all necessary arrangements for the childÕs discharge promptly and that all services and supports are in place for the childÕs successful transition to a different setting. The court may direct the social worker to work with the facility on the childÕs aftercare plans as appro- priate based on the childÕs progress. (H) This paragraph does not prevent the court from holding review hearings more frequently at its discretion. (2)(A) No later than 60 days following the admission of a nonminor dependent to a psychiatric residential treatment facility, and every 30 days thereafter, the court shall hold a review hearing on the child or nonminor dependentÕs placement in the facility based upon the medical necessity of that placement. (B) If the hearing described in subparagraph (A) coincides with the date for a review hearing for a nonminor dependent pursuant to Section 366.31, the court may hold the hearing simultaneously with the status review hearing. (C) At the hearing in subparagraph (A), the court shall consider all of the following: (i) Whether the nonminor dependent continues to consent to the voluntary admission made pursuant to this section. (ii) Whether the nonminor dependentÕs receipt of treatment in the psychiatric residential treatment facility is medically necessary. (iii) Whether there is any less restrictive alternative to meet the nonminor dependentÕs needs, including a less restrictive facility or home or community-based mental health services. (iv) Whether the psychiatric residential treatment facility, which is licensed pursuant to Section 4081, continues to meet its legal obligation to provide services to the nonminor dependent. (v) The county child welfare agencyÕs plan as described in subdivi- sions (c) and (d) of Section 16010.10, and the agencyÕs actions to implement that plan. (D) If the court Þnds at any review hearing that the nonminor depen- dent continues to voluntarily consent to admission and that the evidence supports the nonminor dependentÕs need for care and treatment in the psychiatric residential treatment facility, the court shall enter these Þndings in the record and direct the social worker to transmit them to the facility or interdisciplinary team. The court may direct the social worker to work with the facility on the nonminor dependentÕs aftercare plan as appropriate based on the nonminor dependentÕs need to achieve indepen- dence. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  (E)(i) If the court Þnds that the nonminor dependent no longer volun- tarily consents to admission, the social worker shall notify the facility and immediately work with the nonminor dependent and the facility for discharge to a less restrictive setting with the appropriate and neces- sary services and supports in place. A statement from the nonminor dependentÕs attorney that the nonminor dependent no longer gives voluntary consent to the admission to the facility is be sufficient to support a Þnding that the nonminor dependent no longer gives volun- tary consent. The court shall set a hearing no later than 30 days to verify that the nonminor dependent has been discharged. If the nonminor dependent has not been discharged by the time of the hearing, the court shall issue any and all orders to effectuate the nonminor dependentÕs immediate discharge, including exercising its powers under subdivision (b) of Section 362. This paragraph does not preclude involuntary detention of the nonminor dependent pursuant to the requirements of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act if the nonminor dependent withdraws voluntary consent. This paragraph does not preclude the nonminor dependent from arranging their own discharge from the facility without a court order. (ii) If the courtÕs determination under clause (i) includes a determi- nation that the nonminor dependent should receive treatment through another hospital, program, facility, or community-based mental health service, the court shall hold a hearing no later than 60 days from the nonminor dependentÕs discharge to ensure that the other services have been provided. (F) If the court determines the psychiatric residential treatment facil- ity, which is licensed pursuant to Section 4081, failed to meet its legal obligation to provide services to the nonminor dependent, it may direct the social worker to engage with the facility to ensure the nonminor depen- dent is receiving all necessary services. If necessary, the court may exercise its powers under subdivision (b) of Section 362. (G) The court may make any orders necessary to ensure that the child welfare agency makes all necessary arrangements for the nonminor dependentÕs discharge promptly and that all services and supports are in place for the childÕs successful transition to a different setting. The court may direct the social worker to work with the facility on the nonminor dependentÕs aftercare plans as appropriate based on the nonminor depen- dentÕs progress. (H) This paragraph does not prevent the court from holding review hearings more frequently at its discretion. (g) Whenever a child or nonminor dependent is discharged due to revocation of consent to admission, the county child welfare agency shall, within two court days of being notiÞed of the revocation of consent, Þle a petition pursuant to Section 388 requesting an order vacating the courtÕs authorization of the childÕs or nonminor dependentÕs admission to the facility.

The court may make any orders necessary to ensure that the child welfare agency promptly makes all neces- sary arrangements to ensure that the child or nonminor dependent is dis- charged in a timely manner and with all services and supports in place as necessary for a successful transition to a less restrictive setting. The court may direct the social worker to work with the facility and, where appropriate, the childÕs or nonminor dependentÕs court-appointed conservator, to ensure the child or nonminor dependent is receiving all necessary child welfare services and to develop the childÕs or nonminor dependentÕs aftercare plan as appropri- ate based on the evidence of the childÕs or nonminor dependentÕs progress. (i) The documentation required by this section shall not contain information that is privileged or conÞdential under existing state or federal law or regulation without the appropriate waiver or consent. (j) For purposes of this section, a Òpsychiatric residential treatment facilityÓ refers to a psychiatric residential treatment facility deÞned in Section 1250.10 of the Health and Safety Code. (k) All provisions in this section that apply to nonminor dependents shall apply equally to foster children who remain under juvenile court jurisdiction pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 303 after reaching the age of majority even if they do not meet the deÞnition of Ònonminor dependentÓ contained in subdivision (v) of Section 11400.  HISTORY: Added Stats 2022 ch 589 ¤ 6 (AB 2317), effective January 1, 2023. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Misc.  DIVISION 4 MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY: Added Stats 1967 ch 1667 ¤ 35, operative July 1, 1969.

In order to further limit the Þnancial hardship that those persons may incur as a result of fulÞlling their legal responsibilities, it is necessary that they not be unfairly burdened by legal fees incurred in defending those actions. Therefore, a care custodian, clergy member, health practitioner, or an employee of an adult protective services agency or a local law enforcement agency may present to the Department of General Services a claim for reasonable attorneysÕ fees incurred in any action against that person on the basis of making a report required or authorized by this article if the court has dismissed the action upon a demurrer or motion for summary judgment made by that person, or if he or she prevails in the action.

A county adult protective services agency shall also send a written report thereof within two working days of receiving the information concerning the incident to each agency to which it is required to make a telephone report under this subdivision. Before making any cross-report of allegations of Þnancial abuse to law enforcement agencies, an adult protective services agency shall Þrst deter- mine whether there is reasonable suspicion of any criminal activity. (2) If an adult protective services agency receives a report of abuse alleged to have occurred in a long-term care facility, that adult protective services agency shall immediately inform the person making the report that they are required to make the report to the long-term care ombudsman program or to a local law enforcement agency.

The licensing agency shall investigate the report in light of the potential for physical harm. The trans- mittal of information to the appropriate licensing agency shall not relieve the adult protective services agency or local law enforcement agency or ombuds- man program of the responsibility to continue its own investigation as required under applicable provisions of law.

A local law enforcement agency shall also send a written report thereof within two working days of receiving the information concerning the incident to any agency to which it is required to make a telephone report under this subdivision. (d) A long-term care ombudsman coordinator may report the instance of abuse to the county adult protective services agency or to the local law enforcement agency for assistance in the investigation of the abuse if the victim gives their consent. A long-term care ombudsman program and the Licensing and CertiÞcation Division of the State Department of Public Health shall immediately report by telephone and in writing within two working days to the Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse any instance of neglect occurring in a health care facility that has seriously harmed any patient or reasonably appears to present a serious threat to the health or physical well-being of a patient in that facility.

INTRODUCTION  The Board of Psychology of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (hereinafter Òthe BoardÓ) is a consumer protection agency with the priority of protecting consumers of psychological services from unsafe, incompetent, or negligent practitioners in exercising its licensing, regulatory, and disciplinary functions. In keeping with its mandate to protect this particularly vulnerable population, the Board has adopted the following recommended guidelines for disciplinary orders and conditions of probation for violations of the Psychology Licensing Law. This document, designed for use by administrative law judges, attorneys, psychologists, registered psychologists, psychological assistants, others involved in the disciplinary process, and ultimately the Board, may be revised from time to time.  For purposes of this document, in addition to licensure as a psychologist, the term ÒlicenseÓ includes a psychological assistant registration and registered psychologist registration. The terms and conditions of probation are divided into two general categories:  (1) Standard Conditions are those conditions of probation which will generally appear in all cases involving probation as a standard term and condition; and (2) Optional Conditions are those conditions that address the specific circumstances of the case and require discretion to be exercised depending on the nature and circumstances of a particular case.  The Board of PsychologyÕs Uniform Standards Related to Substance Abusing Licensees, which are derived from the Department of Consumer AffairsÕ Substance Abuse Coordination CommitteeÕs ÒUniform Standards Regarding Substance-Abusing Healing Arts Licensees (4/11)Ó pursuant to section 315 of the Code, describe those terms or conditions that shall be applied to a substance abusing licensee, and are incorporated into the terms and conditions of probation.  The Board recognizes that an individual case may necessitate a departure from these guidelines for disciplinary orders. However, in such a case, the mitigating or aggravating circumstances must be detailed in the ÒFinding of Fact,Ó which is in every Proposed Decision, so that the circumstances can be better understood and evaluated by the Board before final action is taken.  If at the time of hearing, the Administrative Law Judge finds that the respondent, for any reason, is not capable of safe practice, the Board expects outright revocation or denial of the license. This is particularly true in any case of patient sexual abuse. In less egregious cases, a stayed revocation with probation pursuant to the attached Penalty Guidelines would be appropriate. DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  II. DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES  A. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  Factors to be considered - In determining whether revocation, suspension, or probation is to be imposed in a given case, factors such as the following should be considered:  1. Nature and severity of the act(s), offense(s), or crime(s) under consideration. 2. Actual or potential harm to any consumer, client or the public. 3. Prior record of discipline or citations. 4. Number and/or variety of current violations. 5. Mitigation and aggravation evidence. 6. Rehabilitation evidence. 7. In the case of a criminal conviction, compliance with terms of sentence and/or court- ordered probation. 8. Overall criminal record. 9. Time passed since the act(s) or offense(s) occurred. 10. Whether or not the respondent cooperated with the BoardÕs investigation, other law enforcement or regulatory agencies, and/or the injured parties. 11. Recognition by respondent of his or her wrongdoing and demonstration of corrective action to prevent recurrence.  Pursuant to section 2960.1 of the Code (set out below in the Penalty Guidelines), any proposed decision or decision that contains any finding of fact that the licensee or registrant engaged in any act of sexual contact, when that act is with a patient, or with a former patient within two years following termination of therapy, shall contain an order of revocation. The revocation shall not be stayed by the Administrative Law Judge.  Pursuant to section 2964.3 of the Code, any person required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Section 290 of the Penal Code is not eligible for licensure or registration by the Board.  Except where an order is required by statute, deviation from the Disciplinary Guidelines, including the standard terms of probation, is appropriate where the Board determines that the facts of the particular case warrant such a deviation.  B. PENALTY GUIDELINES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS  The general bases for discipline are listed by statute number in the Business & Professions Code. An accusation, statement of issues, or other charging document may also allege violations of other related statutes or regulations. The bases are followed by the Board-determined penalty, including the names and numbers for the optional terms and conditions. The standard terms of probation as stated shall be included in all decisions and orders. Except where there is a finding that respondent is a substance-abusing licensee, the Board recognizes that the penalties and conditions of probation listed are merely guidelines and that individual cases will necessitate variations that take into account unique circumstances. BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  If there are deviations or omissions from the guidelines in formulating a Proposed Decision, the Board requires that the Administrative Law Judge hearing the case include an explanation of the deviations or omissions in the Proposed Decision so that the circumstances can be better understood by the Board during its review and consideration of the Proposed Decision for final action.  Business and Professions Code ¤ 2960 2960 GENERAL UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT MAXIMUM: Revocation; denial of license or registration.  MINIMUM: Revocation stayed, depending upon the circumstances, up to 5-year probation, psychological evaluation and/or therapy if appropriate (2) and (6), California Psychology Law and Ethics Examination (CPLEE) (7), and standard terms and conditions (14-31)  2960(a) CONVICTION OF A CRIME SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF PSYCHOLOGY  MAXIMUM: Revocation; denial of license or registration.  MINIMUM: Revocation stayed, 5-year probation, billing monitor (if financial crime) (4), therapy (6), CPLEE (7), restitution (if appropriate) (8), and standard terms and conditions (14-31).  2960(b) USE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OR ALCOHOL IN A DANGEROUS MANNER  MAXIMUM: Revocation; denial of license or registration.  MINIMUM: Revocation stayed, 5-year probation, physical examination (if appropriate) (3), practice monitor (4), psychological evaluation and ongoing therapy (if appropriate) (2) and (6), clinical diagnostic evaluation (9), participation in an alcohol/drug abuse treatment program (10) and ongoing support group (11), abstain from all non-prescribed, controlled drugs and alcohol/biological fluid and specimen testing [required for substance- abusing licensees] (12), and standard terms and conditions (14-31).  2960(c) FRAUDULENTLY OR NEGLECTFULLY MISREPRESENTING THE TYPE OR STATUS OF LICENSE OR REGISTRATION ACTUALLY HELD  MAXIMUM: Revocation; denial of license or registration.        DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines   MINIMUM: Revocation stayed, 5-year probation, and standard terms and conditions (14-31).  2960(d) IMPERSONATING ANOTHER PERSON HOLDING A PSYCHOLOGY LICENSE OR ALLOWING ANOTHER PERSON TO USE HIS OR HER LICENSE OR REGISTRATION  MAXIMUM: Revocation; denial of license or registration.  MINIMUM: Revocation stayed, 5-year probation, psychological evaluation (2), CPLEE (7), and standard terms and conditions (14-31).  2960(e) PROCURING A LICENSE BY FRAUD OR DECEPTION  Penalty: Revocation is the only suitable penalty inasmuch as the license would not have been issued but for the fraud or deception.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION  Terms and conditions of probation are divided into two categories. The first category consists of optional terms and conditions that may be appropriate as demonstrated in the Penalty Guidelines depending on the nature and circumstances of each particular case. The second category consists of the standard terms and conditions, which must appear in all Proposed Decisions and Stipulated Settlements.       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  To enhance the clarity of a Proposed Decision or Stipulation, the Board requests that all optional conditions (1-13) that are being imposed be listed first in sequence followed immediately by all of the standard terms and conditions, which include cost recovery (15-31).  A. OPTIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS  Listed below are optional conditions of probation that the Board would expect to be included in any Proposed Decision or Stipulation as appropriate.  1. Actual Suspension  As part of probation, respondent is suspended from the practice of psychology for    days beginning with the effective date of this Decision. During the suspension, any probation period is tolled and will not commence again until the suspension is completed.  RATIONALE: A suspension longer than 6 months is not effective, and a violation or violations warranting a longer suspension should result in revocation, not stayed.  2. Psychological Evaluation  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision and on a periodic basis thereafter as may be required by the Board or its designee, respondent shall undergo a psychological evaluation (and psychological testing, if deemed necessary) by a Board- appointed California-licensed psychologist. Respondent shall sign a release that authorizes the evaluator to furnish the Board a current DSM V diagnosis and a written report regarding the respondentÕs judgment and/or ability to function independently as a psychologist with safety to the public, and whatever other information the Board deems relevant to the case. The completed evaluation is the sole property of the Board. The evaluation should not be disclosed to anyone not authorized by the Board or by court order.  If the Board concludes from the results of the evaluation that respondent is unable to practice independently and safely, upon written notice from the Board, respondent shall immediately cease accepting new patients and, in accordance with professional standards, shall appropriately refer/terminate existing patients within thirty (30) days and shall not resume practice until a Board-appointed evaluator determines that respondent is safe to practice. The term of probation shall be extended by this period of time that he or she was ordered to cease practice.  If not otherwise ordered herein, if ongoing psychotherapy is recommended in the psychological evaluation, the Board will notify respondent in writing to submit to such therapy and to select a psychotherapist for approval by the Board or its designee within thirty (30) days of such notification. The therapist shall (1) be a California-licensed psychologist with a clear and current license; (2) have no previous business, professional, personal or other relationship with respondent; (3) not be the same person as respondentÕs practice or billing monitor. Frequency of psychotherapy shall be determined upon recommendation of the treating psychotherapist with approval by the Board or its designee.      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Respondent shall continue psychotherapy until released by the approved psychologist and approved by the Board or its designee. The Board or its designee may order a re-evaluation upon receipt of the therapistÕs recommendation.  Respondent shall execute a release authorizing the therapist to provide to the Board any information the Board or its designee deems appropriate, including quarterly reports of respondentÕs therapeutic progress. Respondent shall furnish a copy of this Decision to the therapist. If the therapist determines that the respondent cannot continue to independently render psychological services, with safety to the public, he/she shall notify the Board immediately.  Respondent shall pay all costs associated with the psychological evaluation and ongoing psychotherapy. Failure to pay costs will be considered a violation of the probation order.  Option of Evaluation as a Condition Precedent:  In some cases, the psychological evaluation may be imposed as either a condition precedent to the continued practice of psychology, or to the issuance or reinstatement of a license, so that the respondent or petitioner is not entitled to begin or continue practice until found to be safe to do so. In such cases, the following language shall be used as the first sentence of the first paragraph of this term:  As a condition precedent to the [continued practice of psychology][issuance of a license] [reinstatement of a license], within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision, and on a periodic basis thereafter as may be required by the Board or its designee, Respondent shall undergo a psychological evaluation (and psychological testing, if deemed necessary) by a Board-appointed California-licensed psychologist. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is not entitled to practice.  In addition, the following language shall also be used as the first sentence of the second paragraph of this term:  If the Board concludes from the results of the evaluation that [respondent][petitioner] is unable to practice independently and safely, upon written notice from the Board [respondent shall, in accordance with professional standards, appropriately refer/terminate existing patients within thirty (30) days and shall not resume practice until a Board-appointed evaluator determines that respondent is safe to practice][respondent or petitioner shall not be issued or have reinstated a license until a Board-appointed evaluator determines that respondent or petitioner is safe to practice].  RATIONALE: Psychological evaluations shall be utilized when an offense calls into question the judgment and/or emotional and/or mental condition of the respondent or where there has been a history of abuse or dependency of alcohol or controlled substances. When appropriate, respondent shall be barred from rendering psychological services under the terms of probation until he or she has undergone an       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  evaluation, the evaluator has recommended resumption of practice, and the Board has accepted and approved the evaluation.  3. Physical Examination  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision, respondent shall undergo a physical examination by a physician and surgeon (physician) licensed in California and approved by the Board. Respondent shall sign a release authorizing the physician to furnish the Board a report that shall provide an assessment of respondentÕs physical condition and capability to safely provide psychological services to the public. If the evaluating physician determines that respondentÕs physical condition prevents safe practice, or that he or she can only practice with restrictions, the physician shall notify the Board, in writing, within five (5) working days.  The Board shall notify respondent in writing of the physicianÕs determination of unfitness to practice, and shall order the respondent to cease practice or place restrictions on respondentÕs practice. Respondent shall comply with any order to cease practice or restriction of his or her practice, and shall immediately cease accepting new patients and, in accordance with professional standards, shall appropriately refer/terminate existing patients within thirty (30) days. Respondent shall not resume practice until a Board-appointed evaluator determines that respondent is safe to practice, and the Board is satisfied of respondentÕs fitness to practice safely and has so notified respondent in writing. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice. If the evaluating physician determines it to be necessary, a recommended treatment program will be instituted and followed by the respondent with the physician providing written progress reports to the Board on a quarterly basis or as otherwise determined by the Board or its designee.  It shall be the respondentÕs responsibility to assure that the required quarterly progress reports are filed by the treating physician in a timely manner. Respondent shall pay all costs of such examination(s). Failure to pay these costs shall be considered a violation of probation.  RATIONALE: This condition permits the Board to require the probationer to obtain appropriate treatment for physical problems/disabilities that could affect safe practice of psychology. The physical examination can also be conducted to ensure that there is no physical evidence of alcohol/drug abuse.  4. Practice Monitor/Billing Monitor/Worksite Monitor  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision, respondent shall submit to the Board or its designee for prior approval, the name and qualifications of a psychologist who has agreed to serve as a [practice monitor][billing monitor][worksite monitor]. The [practice monitor][billing monitor] shall (1) be a California-licensed psychologist with a clear and current license; (2) have no prior business, professional, personal or other relationship with respondent; and (3) not be the same person as respondentÕs therapist. The monitorÕs      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  education and experience shall be in the same field of practice as that of the respondent. The [practice monitor][billing monitor] may also serve as a worksite monitor, if ordered for a substance-abusing licensee, as long as he or she also meets the requirements for a worksite monitor.  Once approved, the monitor(s) shall submit to the Board or its designee a plan by which respondentÕs practice shall be monitored. Monitoring shall consist of a least one hour per week of individual face to face meetings and shall continue during the entire probationary period unless modified or terminated by the Board or its designee. The respondent shall provide the [practice][billing] monitor with a copy of this Decision and access to respondentÕs fiscal and/or patient records. Respondent shall obtain any necessary patient releases to enable the [practice][billing] monitor to review records and to make direct contact with patients. Respondent shall execute a release authorizing the monitor to divulge any information that the Board may request. It shall be respondentÕs responsibility to assure that the monitor submits written reports to the Board or its designee on a quarterly basis verifying that monitoring has taken place and providing an evaluation of respondentÕs performance.  Respondent shall notify all current and potential patients of any term or condition of probation that will affect their therapy or the confidentiality of their records (such as this condition, which requires a [practice monitor][billing monitor]). Such notifications shall be signed by each patient prior to continuing or commencing treatment.  Add the language of the next 3 paragraphs regarding reporting by a worksite monitor if one is ordered for a substance-abusing licensee:  The worksite monitor shall not have a current or former financial, personal, or familial relationship with the licensee, or other relationship that could reasonably be expected to compromise the ability of the monitor to render impartial and unbiased reports to the Board. All other requirements for a worksite monitor shall meet the requirements of a worksite monitor under Uniform Standards #7. Reporting by the worksite monitor to the Board shall be as follows:  Any suspected substance abuse must be orally reported to the Board and the licenseeÕs employer within one (1) business day of occurrence. If the occurrence is not during the BoardÕs normal business hours, the oral report must be within one (1) hour of the next business day. A written report shall be submitted to the Board within forty-eight (48) hours of occurrence.  The worksite monitor shall complete and submit a written report monthly or as directed by the Board. The report shall include: the licenseeÕs name; license number; worksite monitorÕs name and signature; worksite monitorÕs license number; worksite location(s); dates licensee had face-to-face contact with monitor; worksite staff interviewed as applicable; attendance report; any change in behavior and/or personal habits; any indicators that can lead to suspected substance abuse.       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  The licensee shall complete the required consent forms and sign an agreement with the worksite monitor and the Board to allow the Board to communicate with the worksite monitor.  If the monitor(s) quit(s) or is otherwise no longer available, respondent shall notify the Board within ten (10) days and get approval from the Board for a new monitor within thirty (30) days. If no new monitor is approved within thirty (30) days, respondent shall not practice until a new monitor has been approved by the Board or its designee. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice. Respondent shall pay all costs associated with this monitoring requirement. Failure to pay these costs shall be considered a violation of probation.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD #7: Monitoring shall be utilized when respondentÕs ability to function independently is in doubt or when fiscal improprieties have occurred, as a result of a deficiency in knowledge or skills, or as a result of questionable judgment. A worksite monitor may be ordered where the Uniform Standards Related to a Substance-Abusing Licensee apply, if necessary for the protection of the public.  5. Restriction of Patient Population  RespondentÕs practice shall be restricted to exclude patients who are . Within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the decision, respondent shall submit to the Board or its designee, for prior approval, a plan to implement this restriction. Respondent shall submit proof satisfactory to the Board or its designee of compliance with this term of probation.  RATIONALE: In cases wherein some factor of the patient population at large (e.g. age, gender, practice setting) may put a patient at risk if in therapy with the respondent, language appropriate to the case may be developed to restrict such a population. The language would vary greatly by case.  6. Psychotherapy  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision, a therapist shall be selected by the respondent for approval by the Board. The therapist shall (1) be a California-licensed psychologist with a clear and current license; (2) have no previous business, professional, personal, or other relationship with respondent; and (3) not be the same person as respondentÕs monitor. Respondent shall furnish a copy of this Decision to the therapist. Psychotherapy shall, at a minimum, consist of one hour per week over a period of fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks after which it may continue or terminate upon the written recommendation of the therapist with written approval by the Board or its designee. The Board or its designee may order a psychological evaluation upon receipt of the therapistÕs recommendation.        DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Respondent shall execute a release authorizing the therapist to provide to the Board or its designee any information the Board deems appropriate, including quarterly reports of respondentÕs therapeutic progress. It shall be respondentÕs responsibility to assure that the required quarterly reports are filed by the therapist in a timely manner. If the therapist notifies the Board that the therapist believes the respondent cannot continue to safely render psychological services, upon notification from the Board respondent shall immediately cease accepting new patients and, in accordance with professional standards, shall appropriately refer/terminate existing patients within thirty (30) days and shall not resume practice until a Board-appointed evaluator determines that respondent is again safe to practice. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice.  If, prior to the termination of probation, respondent is found not to be mentally fit to resume the practice of psychology without restrictions, the Board shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the respondentÕs license and the term of probation shall be extended until the Board or its designee determines that the respondent is mentally fit to resume the practice of psychology without restrictions.  Cost of psychotherapy is to be paid by the respondent.  RATIONALE: The need for psychotherapy may be determined pursuant to a psychological evaluation or as evident from the facts of the case. The frequency of psychotherapy shall be related to the offense involved and the extent to which the offense calls into question the judgment, motivation, and emotional and/or mental condition of the respondent.  7. Examination(s)  Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP) or California Psychology Law and Ethics Examination (CPLEE) Term MUST INCLUDE either Option 1 or Option 2:  Option 1 (Condition Subsequent)  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the decision, respondent shall take and pass the [EPPP][CPLEE]. If respondent fails to take or fails such examination, the Board shall order respondent to cease practice and upon such order respondent shall immediately cease practice, refrain from accepting new patients and, in accordance with professional standards, shall appropriately refer/terminate existing patients within thirty (30) days and shall not resume practice until the re-examination has been successfully passed, as evidenced by written notice to respondent from the Board or its designee. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondentÕs practice was ordered ceased. It is respondentÕs responsibility to contact the Board in writing to make arrangements for such examination. Respondent shall pay the established examination fee(s). Reexamination after a failure shall be consistent with 16 C.C.R. section 1388(f), and any applicable sections of the Business & Professions Code.      BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  Option 2 (Condition Precedent to either continued practice, or to reinstatement of a license)  Respondent [is ordered to cease the practice of psychology][shall not be reinstated] until respondent has taken and passed the [EPPP][CPLEE]. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice. It is respondentÕs responsibility to contact the Board in writing to make arrangements for such examination(s). Respondent shall pay the established examination fee(s). Re-examination after a failure must be consistent with 16 C.C.R. section 1388(f), and any applicable sections of the Business & Professions Code.  RATIONALE: In cases involving evidence of serious deficiencies in the body of knowledge required to be minimally competent to practice independently, it may be appropriate to require the respondent to take and pass the EPPP, the national examination for psychologists, because the Board no longer administers an examination that tests knowledge of the field, during the course of the probation period. In some instances, it may be appropriate to order that practice be ceased until the examination has been taken and passed (condition precedent). In cases involving deficiencies in knowledge of laws and ethics, the CPLEE may be ordered. Either one or both examinations may be appropriate, depending on the nature of the violation(s).  8. Restitution  Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Decision, respondent shall provide proof to the Board or its designee of restitution in the amount of $ paid to   . Failure to pay restitution shall be considered a violation of probation. Restitution is to be paid regardless of the tolling of probation.  RATIONALE: In offenses involving economic exploitation, restitution is a necessary term of probation. For example, restitution would be a standard term in any case involving Medi-Cal or other insurance fraud. The amount of restitution shall be at a minimum the amount of money that was fraudulently obtained by the licensee. Evidence relating to the amount of restitution would have to be introduced at the Administrative hearing.  9. Clinical Diagnostic Evaluation  Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Decision and at any time upon order of the Board, respondent shall undergo a clinical diagnostic evaluation. Respondent shall provide the evaluator with a copy of the BoardÕs Decision prior to the clinical diagnostic evaluation being performed.  The evaluator shall be a licensed practitioner who holds a valid, unrestricted license to conduct clinical diagnostic evaluations, and has three (3) yearsÕ experience in providing evaluations of health care professionals with substance abuse disorders. The evaluator shall not have or have ever had a financial, personal, business or other relationship with the licensee. Respondent shall cause the evaluator to submit to the Board a written clinical      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  diagnostic evaluation report within ten (10) days from the date the evaluation was completed, unless an extension, not to exceed thirty (30) days, is granted to the evaluator by the Board.  Respondent shall pay all costs associated with the clinical diagnostic evaluation. Failure to pay costs will be considered a violation of the probation order.  The following language for a cease practice order where the evaluation is ordered under the Uniform Standards Related to Substance Abusing Licensees is mandatory, and discretionary in other cases where it may be relevant:  Respondent is ordered to cease any practice of psychology, beginning on the effective date of the Decision, pending the results of the clinical diagnostic evaluation. During this time, Respondent shall submit to random drug testing at least two (2) times per week. At any other time that respondent is ordered to undergo a clinical diagnostic evaluation, he or she shall be ordered to cease any practice of psychology for minimum of thirty (30) days pending the results of a clinical diagnostic evaluation and shall, during such time, submit to drug testing at least two (2) times per week.  Upon any order to cease practice, respondent shall not practice psychology until the Board determines that he or she is able to safely practice either full-time or part-time and has had at least thirty (30) days of negative drug test results. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice. Respondent shall comply with any terms or conditions made by the Board as a result of the clinical diagnostic evaluation.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD #s 1, 2 and 3: This condition is to be considered in cases where the grounds for discipline involve drugs and/or alcohol, or where the Uniform Standards Related to a Substance-Abusing Licensee apply. The cease practice order pending the evaluation is mandatory where the evaluation is ordered for a substance-abusing licensee, and discretionary in other cases where ordered.  10. Alcohol and/or Drug Abuse Treatment Program  Within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the Decision, respondent shall enter an inpatient or outpatient alcohol or other drug abuse recovery program or an equivalent program as approved by the Board or its designee. Components of the treatment program shall be relevant to the violation and to the respondentÕs current status in recovery or rehabilitation. Respondent shall provide the Board or its designee with proof that the approved program was successfully completed. Terminating the program without permission or being expelled for cause shall constitute a violation of probation by respondent. If respondent so terminates or is expelled from the program, respondent shall be ordered by the Board to immediately cease any practice of psychology, and may not practice unless and until notified by the Board. The term of probation shall be extended by the period of time during which respondent is ordered to cease practice.      BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  Respondent shall pay all costs associated with the program. Failure to pay costs will be considered a violation of the probation order.  However, if respondent has already attended such an inpatient or outpatient alcohol or other drug abuse recovery program, as described above, commencing with the current period of sobriety, respondent shall provide the Board or its designee with proof that the program was successfully completed and this shall suffice to comply with this term of probation.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD # 6: This condition is to be considered in cases where the grounds for discipline involve drugs and/or alcohol, or where the Uniform Standards Related to a Substance-Abusing Licensee apply.  11. Ongoing Support Group Program  Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Decision, respondent shall begin and continue attendance at a support/recovery group (e.g., Twelve Step meetings or the equivalent, or a facilitated group with a psychologist trained in alcohol and drug abuse treatment) as ordered by the Board or its designee.  When determining the type and frequency of required support group meeting attendance, the Board shall give consideration to the following:  ¥ the licenseeÕs history; ¥ the documented length of sobriety/time that has elapsed since substance use; ¥ the recommendation of the clinical evaluator; ¥ the scope and pattern of use; ¥ the licenseeÕs treatment history; and, ¥ the nature, duration, and severity of substance abuse.  Verified documentation of attendance shall be submitted by respondent with each quarterly report. Respondent shall continue attendance in such a group for the duration of probation unless notified by the Board that attendance is no longer required.  If a facilitated group support meeting is ordered for a substance-abusing licensee, add the following language regarding the facilitator:  The group facilitator shall meet the following qualifications and requirements:  a. The meeting facilitator must have a minimum of three (3) years experience in the treatment and rehabilitation of substance abuse, and shall be licensed or certified by the state or other nationally certified organizations. b. The meeting facilitator must not have a financial relationship, personal relationship, or business relationship with the licensee in the last five (5) years. c. The meeting facilitator shall provide to the board a signed document showing the licenseeÕs name, facilitatorÕs qualifications, the group name, the date and location of       DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  the meeting, the licenseeÕs attendance, and the licenseeÕs level of participation and progress. d. The facilitator shall report any unexcused absence within twenty-four (24) hours.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD # 5: Alcohol and/or other drug abuse treatment shall be required in addition to other terms of probation in cases where the use of alcohol or other drugs by respondent has impaired respondentÕs ability to safely provide psychological services. This condition must be accompanied by condition #12. This term is to be considered in cases where the grounds for discipline involve drugs and/or alcohol, or where the Uniform Standards Related to a Substance- Abusing Licensee apply. If the Uniform Standards do not apply, where relevant, non- facilitated support group attendance, such as Twelve Step meetings, may be ordered instead of a facilitated group support meeting, or in addition to it.  12. Abstain from Drugs and Alcohol and Submit to Tests and Samples  Respondent shall abstain completely from the personal use or possession of controlled substances as defined in the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, and dangerous drugs as defined by Section 4022 of the Business and Professions Code, or any drugs requiring a prescription unless respondent provides the Board or its designee with documentation from the prescribing health professional that the prescription was legitimately issued and is a necessary part of the treatment of respondent.  Respondent shall abstain completely from the intake of alcohol.  Respondent shall undergo random and directed biological fluid or specimen testing as determined by the Board or its designee. Respondent shall be subject to [a minimum of fifty-two (52)] random tests [per year within the first year of probation, and a minimum of thirty-six (36) random tests per year thereafter,] for the duration of the probationary term.  Testing Frequency Schedule:  Level  Segments of Probation  Minimum Range of Number of Random Tests  I  Year 1  52-104 per year  II  Year 2+  36-104 per year   After 5 years, administration of one (1) time per month if there have been no positive drug tests in the previous five (5) consecutive years of probation.  Nothing precludes the Board from increasing the number of random tests for any reason.  Any confirmed positive finding will be considered a violation of probation. Respondent shall pay all costs associated with such testing. If respondent tests positive for a banned substance, respondent shall be ordered by the Board to immediately cease any practice of psychology, and may not practice unless and until notified by the Board. Respondent shall       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  make daily contact as directed by the Board to determine if he or she must submit to alcohol and/or drug testing. Respondent shall submit to his or her alcohol and/or drug test on the same day that he or she is notified that a test is required. All alternative testing sites due to vacation or travel outside of California must be approved by the Board prior to the vacation or travel.  Drugs - Exception for Personal Illness  Orders forbidding respondent from personal use or possession of controlled substances or dangerous drugs do not apply to medications lawfully prescribed to respondent for a bona fide illness or condition by a licensed health care professional. Respondent shall provide the Board or its designee with written documentation from the treating licensed health care professional who prescribed medication(s). The documentation shall identify the medication, dosage, number of refills, if any; the date the medication was prescribed, the respondentÕs prognosis, the date the medication will no longer be required, and the effect on the recovery plan, if appropriate.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD #s 4 and 8: This condition provides documentation that the probationer is substance or chemical free. It also provides the Board with a mechanism through which to require additional laboratory analyses for the presence of narcotics, alcohol and/or dangerous drugs when the probationer appears to be in violation of the terms of probation or appears to be under the influence of mood altering substances. The Board will consider the following factors in making an exception to the testing frequency:  PREVIOUS TESTING/SOBRIETY: In cases where the Board has evidence that a licensee has participated in a treatment or monitoring program requiring random testing prior to being subject to testing by the Board, the Board may give consideration to that testing in altering the testing frequency schedule so that it is equivalent to this standard.  VIOLATION(S) OUTSIDE OF EMPLOYMENT: An individual whose license is placed on probation for a single conviction or incident or two convictions or incidents, spanning greater than seven years from each other, where those violations did not occur at work or while on the licenseeÕs way to work, where alcohol or drugs were a contributing factor, may bypass level I and participate in level II of the testing frequency schedule.  SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NOT DIAGNOSED: In cases where no current substance use disorder diagnosis is made, a lesser period of monitoring and toxicology screening may be adopted by the Board, but not to be less than 24 times per year.  The term is mandatory in cases where the Uniform Standards Related to a Substance- Abusing Licensee apply. Where the Uniform Standards do not apply, where relevant,       DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  the respondent should be ordered to submit to random and directed testing, but need not be ordered to submit to the minimum of random tests.  13. Educational Review  Respondent shall submit to an educational review concerning the circumstances that resulted in this administrative action. The educational review shall be conducted by a board- appointed expert familiar with the case. Educational reviews are informational only and intended to benefit respondentÕs practice. Respondent shall pay all costs associated with this educational review.  RATIONALE: In cases involving evidence of deficiencies in the body of knowledge required to be minimally competent to practice independently, it may be appropriate to require the respondent to submit to an educational review during the course of the probation period.  B. STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS (To be included in ALL Proposed Decisions and Stipulations)  14. Notification to Employer  When currently employed, applying for employment or negotiating a contract, or contracted to provide psychological services, respondent shall provide to each employers, supervisor, or contractor, or prospective employer or contractor where respondent is providing or would provide psychological services, a copy of this Decision and the Accusation or Statement of Issues before accepting or continuing employment. Notification to the respondentÕs current employer shall occur no later than the effective date of the Decision. Respondent shall submit, upon request by the Board or its designee, satisfactory evidence of compliance with this term of probation.  The respondent shall provide to the Board the names, physical addresses, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of all employers and supervisors, or contractors, and shall inform the Board in writing of the facility or facilities at which the person is providing psychological services, the name(s) of the person(s) to whom the BoardÕs decision was provided.  Respondent shall complete the required consent forms and sign an agreement with the employer and supervisor, or contractor, and the Board to allow the Board to communicate with the employer and supervisor, or contractor.  15.

The cost associated with the law and ethics course shall be paid by the respondent.  17. Investigation/Enforcement Cost Recovery  Respondent shall pay to the Board its costs of investigation and enforcement in the amount of $ within the first year of probation. Such costs shall be payable to the Board of Psychology and are to be paid regardless of whether the probation is tolled. Failure to pay such costs shall be considered a violation of probation.  Any and all requests for a payment plan shall be submitted in writing by respondent to the Board. However, full payment of any and all costs required by this condition must be received by the Board no later than six (6) months prior to the scheduled termination of probation.  The filing of bankruptcy by respondent shall not relieve respondent of the responsibility to repay investigation and enforcement costs.  18. Probation Costs  Respondent shall pay the costs associated with probation monitoring each and every year of probation. Such costs shall be payable to the Board of Psychology at the end of each fiscal year (June 30). Failure to pay such costs shall be considered a violation of probation.  The filing of bankruptcy by respondent shall not relieve respondent of the responsibility to repay probation monitoring costs.  19. Obey All Laws  Respondent shall obey all federal, state, and local laws and all regulations governing the practice of psychology in California including the ethical guidelines of the American      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Psychological Association. A full and detailed account of any and all violations of law shall be reported by the respondent to the Board or its designee in writing within seventy-two (72) hours of occurrence.  CRIMINAL COURT ORDERS: If respondent is under criminal court orders by any governmental agency, including probation or parole, and the orders are violated, this shall be deemed a violation of probation and may result in the filing of an accusation or petition to revoke probation or both.  OTHER BOARD OR REGULATORY AGENCY ORDERS: If respondent is subject to any other disciplinary order from any other health-care related board or any professional licensing or certification regulatory agency in California or elsewhere, and violates any of the orders or conditions imposed by other agencies, this shall be deemed a violation of probation and may result in the filing of an accusation or petition to revoke probation or both.  20. Quarterly Reports  Respondent shall submit quarterly declarations under penalty of perjury on forms provided by the Board or its designee, stating whether there has been compliance with all the conditions of probation. Quarterly reports attesting to non-practice status are to be submitted if probation is tolled.  Respondent shall submit a quarterly report no later than seven (7) calendar days from the beginning of the assigned quarter.  21. Probation Compliance  Respondent shall comply with the BoardÕs probation program and shall, upon reasonable notice, report to the assigned Board of Psychology probation monitor. Respondent shall contact the assigned probation monitor regarding any questions specific to the probation order. Respondent shall not have any unsolicited or unapproved contact with (1) complainants associated with the case; (2) Board members or members of its staff; or (3) persons serving the Board as expert evaluators.  22. Interview with Board or Its Designee  Respondent shall appear in person for interviews with the Board or its designee upon request at various intervals and with reasonable notice.  23. Changes of Employment/Address  Respondent shall, at all times, keep the Board informed of respondentÕs business and residence addresses. Respondent shall notify the Board in writing, through the assigned probation monitor, of any and all changes of employment, location, and address within thirty (30) days of such change.       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  24. Tolling for Out-of-State Practice, Residence or Extension of Probation for In-State Non-Practice  In the event respondent should leave California to reside or to practice outside the State for any reason, respondent shall notify the Board or its designee in writing within ten (10) days of the dates of departure and return to California. All provisions of probation other than the quarterly report requirements, restitution, cost recovery, and coursework requirements, shall be held in abeyance until respondent resumes practice in California. All provisions of probation shall recommence on the effective date of resumption of practice in California, and the term of probation shall be extended for the period of time respondent was out of state.  Unless by Board order, in the event respondent is not engaging in the practice of psychology while residing in California, respondent shall notify the Board or its designee in writing within ten (10) days of the dates of cessation of practice and expected return to practice. Non-practice is defined as any period of time exceeding thirty (30) days in which respondent is not engaging in any activities defined in Sections 2902 and 2903 of the Business and Professions Code. All provisions of probation shall remain in effect, and the term of probation shall be extended for the period of time respondent was not engaged in the practice of psychology as required by other employment requirements of this order.  25. Employment and Supervision of Trainees  If respondent is licensed as a psychologist, he/she shall not employ or supervise or apply to employ or supervise psychological assistants, interns or trainees. Any such supervisorial relationship in existence on the effective date of this Decision and Order shall be terminated by respondent and/or the Board.  26.

Future Registration or Licensure  If respondent is registered as a psychological assistant or registered psychologist and subsequently obtains other psychological assistant or registered psychologist registrations or becomes licensed as a psychologist during the course of this probationary order, this Decision shall remain in full force and effect until the probationary period is successfully terminated. Future registrations or licensure shall not be approved, however, unless respondent is currently in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of probation.  28. Request for Modification  ÒRequestÓ as used in this condition is a request made to the BoardÕs designee, and not under the Administrative Procedure Act.      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  The licensee shall demonstrate that he or she has met the following criteria before being granted a request to modify a practice restriction ordered by the Board staff pursuant to the Uniform Standards:  a. Demonstrated sustained compliance with current recovery program. b. Demonstrated the ability to practice safely as evidenced by current work site reports, evaluations, and any other information relating to the licenseeÕs substance abuse. c. Negative alcohol and drug screening reports for at least six (6) months, two (2) positive worksite monitor reports, and complete compliance with other terms and conditions of the program.  RATIONALE and APPLICATION OF UNIFORM STANDARD #11: This term is a standard term for all substance abusing licensees. It applies to request for a notification of terms and conditions that are within the purview of the BoardÕs Probation Monitor.  29. Violation of Probation  If respondent violates probation in any respect, the Board may, after giving respondent notice and the opportunity to be heard, revoke probation and carry out the disciplinary order that was stayed. If an Accusation or Petition to Revoke Probation is filed against respondent during probation, the Board shall have continuing jurisdiction until the matter is final, and the term of probation shall be extended until the matter is final. No Petition for Modification or Termination of Probation shall be considered while there is an Accusation or Petition to Revoke Probation pending against respondent.  30. Completion of Probation  Upon successful completion of probation, respondentÕs license shall be fully restored.  31. License Surrender  Following the effective date of this Decision, if respondent ceases practicing due to retirement, health reasons or is otherwise unable to satisfy the terms and conditions of probation, respondent may request the voluntary surrender of his or her license or registration. The Board of Psychology or its designee reserves the right to evaluate respondentÕs request and to exercise its discretion whether or not to grant the request, or to take any other action deemed appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances. Upon formal acceptance of the surrender, respondent shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days, deliver respondentÕs pocket and/or wall certificate to the Board or its designee and respondent shall no longer practice psychology. Respondent will no longer be subject to the terms and conditions of probation and the surrender of respondentÕs license shall be deemed disciplinary action. If respondent reapplies for a psychology license or registration, the application shall be treated as a petition for reinstatement of a revoked license or registration.       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  C. STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS (To be included in ALL Stipulations for Surrender or Revocation)  32. Reinstatement and Investigation/Enforcement Cost Recovery  Respondent may not petition for reinstatement of a revoked or surrendered license/registration for three (3) years from the effective date of this Decision. If the Board grants future reinstatement, respondent agrees to reimburse the Board for its costs of investigation and enforcement of this matter in the amount of $ payable to the Board upon the effective date of such reinstatement Decision.  33. Relinquish License  Respondent shall relinquish his/her wall and pocket certificate of licensure or registration to the Board or its designee once this Decision becomes effective and upon request.   IV. PROPOSED DECISIONS  A. Contents: The Board requests that Proposed Decisions include the following:  a. Specific code section(s) violated with the definition of the code(s) in the Determination of Issues. b. Clear description of the acts or omissions which caused the violation. c. RespondentÕs explanation of the violation(s) in the Findings of Fact if he/she was present at the hearing. d. Description of all evidence of mitigation, rehabilitation and aggravation presented at the hearing. e. Explanation of any deviation from the BoardÕs Disciplinary Guidelines.  When a probation order is imposed, the Board requests that the order first list any combination of the Optional Terms and Conditions (1-13) as they may pertain to the particular case followed by all of the Standard Terms and Conditions (14-31).  If the respondent fails to appear for his/her scheduled hearing or does not submit a Notice of Defense form, such inaction shall result in a default decision to revoke licensure or deny application.  B. Recommended Language for Issuance and Placement of a License on Probation, and Reinstatement of License  Disciplining of a License/Registration:  ÒIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the [registration][license] issued to respondent is REVOKED. However, the order of revocation is STAYED and the [registration][license] is placed on probation for [#] years subject to the following terms and conditionsÓ:      DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Applicant Placed on Probation:  ÒIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for [licensure][registration] is GRANTED, and upon successful completion of all [licensing][registration] requirements a [license][registration] shall be issued, provided that all [licensing][registration] requirements are completed within two (2) years of the effective date of this decision. If a [license][registration] is not issued within two (2) years of the effective date of this decision, the application is ordered denied, and a new application will be required. Upon issuance, however, said [license][registration] shall immediately be REVOKED. However, the order of revocation shall be STAYED, and the [license][registration] is placed on probation for [#] years subject to the following terms and conditionsÓ:  Reinstatement of a License:  ÒThe petition of [name], [Ph.D.][PsyD.], for reinstatement of licensure is hereby GRANTED. Psychologist license number [#] shall be reinstated provided that all licensing requirements are completed within two (2) years of the effective date of this decision. If the license is not reinstated within two (2) years of the effective date of this decision, the petition is ordered denied, and a new petition for reinstatement will be required. Upon reinstatement, however, the license shall be immediately revoked. However, the order of revocation shall be STAYED, and petitionerÕs license shall be placed on probation for a period of [#] years subject to the terms and following conditions:Ó  V. REHABILITATION CRITERIA FOR REINSTATEMENT/PENALTY RELIEF HEARINGS  The primary concerns of the Board at reinstatement or penalty relief hearings are (1) the Rehabilitation Criteria for Denials and Reinstatements in California Code of Regulations, Title 16, section 1395; and (2) the evidence presented by the petitioner of his/her rehabilitation. The Board will not retry the original revocation or probation case.  The Board will consider, pursuant to Section 1395, the following criteria of rehabilitation:  (1) The nature and severity of the act(s) or crime(s) under consideration as grounds for denial. (2) Evidence of any act(s) committed subsequent to the act(s) or crime(s) under consideration as grounds for denial which also could be considered as grounds for denial under section 480 of the Code. (3) The time that has elapsed since commission of the act(s) of crime(s) referred to in subdivision (1) or (2). (4) The extent to which the applicant has complied with any terms of parole, probation, restitution, or any other sanctions lawfully imposed against the applicant. (5) Evidence, if any, of rehabilitation submitted by the applicant.  The Board requests that comprehensive information be elicited from the petitioner regarding his/her rehabilitation. The petitioner should provide details that include:       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  A. Why the penalty should be modified or why the license should be reinstated. B. Specifics of rehabilitative efforts and results which should include programs, psychotherapy, medical treatment, etc., and the duration of such efforts. C. Continuing education pertaining to the offense and its effect on his or her practice of psychology. D. If applicable, copies of court documents pertinent to conviction, including documents specifying conviction and sanctions, and proof of completion of sanctions. E. If applicable, copy of Certificate of Rehabilitation or evidence of expungement proceedings. F. If applicable, evidence of compliance with and completion of terms of probation, parole, restitution, or any other sanctions.  Rehabilitation is evaluated according to an internal subjective measure of attitude (state of mind) and an external objective measure of conduct (state of facts). The state of mind demonstrating rehabilitation is one that has a mature, measured appreciation of the gravity of the misconduct and remorse for the harm caused. Petitioner must take responsibility for the misconduct and show an appreciation for why it is wrong. Petitioner must also show a demonstrated course of conduct that convinces and assures the Board that the public would be safe if petitioner is permitted to be licensed to practice psychology. Petitioner must show a track record of reliable, responsible, and consistently appropriate conduct.  In the Petition Decision, the Board requests a summary of the offense and the specific codes violated that resulted in the revocation, surrender or probation of the license.  If the Board should deny a request for reinstatement of licensure or penalty relief, the Board requests that the Administrative Law Judge provide technical assistance in the formulation of language clearly setting forth the reasons for denial. Such language would include methodologies or approaches that demonstrate rehabilitation. Petitioners for reinstatement must wait three (3) years from the effective date of their revocation decisions or one (1) year from the last petition for reinstatement decisions before filing for reinstatement.  If a petitioner fails to appear for his/her scheduled reinstatement or penalty relief hearing, such inaction shall result in a default decision to deny reinstatement of the license or registration or reduction of penalty.   VI. UNIFORM STANDARDS RELATED TO SUBSTANCE ABUSING LICENSEES  The following Uniform Standards describe the conditions that apply to a substance abusing applicant or licensee, and have been incorporated into the terms and conditions of probation. If the ground(s) for discipline involves drugs and/or alcohol, the applicant or licensee shall be presumed to be a substance-abusing applicant or licensee for purposes of section 315 of the Code. If the applicant or licensee does not rebut that presumption, there shall be a finding that he or she is a substance abusing applicant or licensee, and the Uniform Standards for a substance abusing applicant or licensee shall apply as written and be used in the order placing the license on probation.       DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Clinical Diagnostic Evaluations [Uniform Standard #1]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 9)  Whenever a licensee is ordered to undergo a clinical diagnostic evaluation, the evaluator shall be a licensed practitioner who holds a valid, unrestricted license to conduct clinical diagnostic evaluations, and has three (3) years experience in providing evaluations of health care professionals with substance abuse disorders. The evaluator shall be approved by the Board, and unless permitted by the Board or its designee, shall be a California-licensed psychologist or physician and surgeon. The evaluations shall be conducted in accordance with acceptable professional standards for conducting substance abuse clinical diagnostic evaluations. Whether the clinical diagnostic evaluation is ordered is discretionary. Clinical Diagnostic Evaluation/Cease Practice Order [Uniform Standard #2]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 9)  Unless the presumption that the applicant or licensee is a substance-abusing applicant or licensee is rebutted, and the public can be adequately protected, the Board shall order the applicant or licensee to cease any practice of psychology pending the clinical diagnostic evaluation and a Board determination upon review of the diagnostic evaluation report that the applicant is safe to begin or the licensee is safe to return to practice. If the evaluation is ordered, a cease practice order is mandatory. Clinical Diagnostic Evaluation Report [Uniform Standard #3]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 9)  The clinical diagnostic evaluation report shall set forth, in the evaluatorÕs opinion, whether the licensee has a substance abuse problem, whether the licensee is a threat to himself or herself or others, and recommendations for substance abuse treatment, practice restrictions, or other recommendations related to the licenseeÕs rehabilitation and safe practice.  The evaluator shall not have or have ever had a financial, personal, business or other relationship with the licensee. The evaluator shall provide an objective, unbiased, and independent evaluation.  If the evaluator determines during the evaluation process that a licensee is a threat to himself or herself or others, the evaluator shall notify the Board within twenty-four (24) hours of such a determination.  For all evaluations, a final written report shall be provided to the Board no later than ten (10) days from the date the evaluator is assigned the matter unless the evaluator requests additional information to complete the evaluation, not to exceed thirty (30) days. The Board shall review the clinical diagnostic evaluation to help determine whether or not the licensee is safe to return to either part-time or full-time practice and what restrictions or       BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  recommendations should be imposed on the licensee based on the application of the following criteria:  License type, licenseeÕs history, documented length of sobriety, scope and pattern of substance abuse, treatment history, medical history, current medical condition, nature, duration and severity of substance abuse problem, and whether the licensee is a threat to himself or herself or others.  When determining if the licensee should be required to participate in inpatient, outpatient or any other type of treatment, the Board shall take into consideration the recommendation of the clinical diagnostic evaluation, license type, licenseeÕs history, length of sobriety, scope and pattern of substance abuse, treatment history, medical history, current medical condition, nature, duration and severity of substance abuse and whether the licensee is a threat to himself or herself or others. If the evaluation is ordered, this standard is mandatory. Communication with Employer [Uniform Standard # 4]: (Reflected in Standard Term # 14)  If the licensee whose license is on probation has an employer, the licensee shall provide to the Board the names, physical addresses, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of all employers and supervisors and shall give specific, written consent that the licensee authorizes the Board and the employers and supervisors to communicate regarding the licenseeÕs work status, performance, and monitoring.  Facilitated Group Support Meetings [Uniform Standard #5]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 11)  If the Board requires a licensee to participate in facilitated group support meetings, the following shall apply:  1. When determining the frequency of required group meeting attendance, the Board shall give consideration to the following:  ¥ the licenseeÕs history; ¥ the documented length of sobriety/time that has elapsed since substance use; ¥ the recommendation of the clinical evaluator; ¥ the scope and pattern of use; ¥ the licenseeÕs treatment history; and, ¥ the nature, duration, and severity of substance abuse.  2.

The meeting facilitator shall report any unexcused absence within twenty-four (24) hours.  Whether facilitated support group meetings are ordered is discretionary. (Under the Disciplinary Guidelines, non-facilitated support group attendance, such as Twelve Step meetings, may also be ordered.)  Treatment Program Ð Inpatient, Outpatient, or Other [Uniform Standard #6] (Reflected in Optional Term # 10)  In determining whether inpatient, outpatient, or other type of treatment is necessary, the board shall consider the following criteria: ¥ recommendation of the clinical diagnostic evaluation (if any) pursuant to Uniform Standard #1; ¥ license type; ¥ licenseeÕs history; ¥ documented length of sobriety/time that has elapsed since substance abuse; ¥ scope and pattern of substance use; ¥ licenseeÕs treatment history; ¥ licenseeÕs medical history and current medical condition; ¥ nature, duration, and severity of substance abuse, and ¥ threat to himself/herself or the public. Whether a treatment program is ordered is discretionary. Worksite Monitor Requirements [Uniform Standard # 7]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 4)  If the Board determines that a worksite monitor is necessary for a particular licensee, the worksite monitor must meet the following requirements to be considered for approval by the Board:  The worksite monitor shall not have a current or former financial, personal, or familial relationship with the licensee, or other relationship that could reasonably be expected to compromise the ability of the monitor to render impartial and unbiased reports to the Board. If it is impractical for anyone but the licenseeÕs employer to serve as the worksite monitor, this requirement may be waived by the Board; however, under no circumstances shall a licenseeÕs worksite monitor be an employee or supervisee of the licensee.        BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY Disciplinary Guidelines  The worksite monitorÕs license scope of practice shall include the scope of practice of the licensee who is being monitored or be another health care professional if no monitor with like scope of practice is available, or, as approved by the Board, be a person in a position of authority who is capable of monitoring the licensee at work.  If the worksite monitor is a licensed healthcare professional he or she shall have an active unrestricted license, with no disciplinary action within the last five (5) years.  The worksite monitor shall sign an affirmation that he or she has reviewed the terms and conditions of the licenseeÕs disciplinary order and agrees to monitor the licensee as set forth by the Board.  The worksite monitor must adhere to the following required methods of monitoring the licensee:  (1) Have face-to-face contact with the licensee in the work environment on as frequent a basis as determined by the Board, but at least once per week. (2) Interview other staff in the office regarding the licenseeÕs behavior, if applicable. (3) Review the licenseeÕs work attendance and behavior.  Reporting by the worksite monitor to the Board shall be as follows:  Any suspected substance abuse must be orally reported to the Board and the licenseeÕs employer within one (1) business day of occurrence. If occurrence is not during the BoardÕs normal business hours the oral report must be within one (1) hour of the next business day. A written report shall be submitted to the Board within forty-eight (48) hours of occurrence.  The worksite monitor shall complete and submit a written report monthly or as directed by the Board.

The Board shall also notify the licenseeÕs employer and worksite monitor, if any, that the licensee has been ordered to cease practice, and that he or she may not practice until the Board determines that he or she is able to safely practice. The Board shall determine whether the positive alcohol or drug test is, in fact, evidence of prohibited use, a major violation. If not, the Board shall immediately lift the cease practice order.  Nothing precludes the Board from increasing the number of random tests for any reason. If the Board finds or has suspicion that a licensee has committed a violation of the BoardÕs testing program or who has committed any Major Violation referenced in the Disciplinary Guidelines, the matter shall be referred for disciplinary action to revoke the probation.  The following minimum drug testing standards shall apply to each licensee subject to drug testing:  1. Licensees shall be randomly alcohol or drug tested at least fifty-two (52) times per year for the first year of probation, and at any time as directed by the Board.

Prior to returning to any health care employment, the licensee shall be subject to level I testing frequency for at least 60 days. At such time the licensee returns to employment (in a health care field), if the licensee has not previously met the level I frequency standard, the licensee shall be subject to completing a full year at level I of the testing frequency schedule, otherwise level II testing shall be in effect.        DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Disciplinary Guidelines  Drug testing standards are mandatory and shall apply to a substance-abusing licensee, and the required testing frequency shall be ordered.  Petitioning for Modification to Return to Full Time Practice [Uniform Standard #10]: (Reflected in Optional Term # 28)  ÒPetitionÓ as used in this standard is an informal request for any term or condition that is within the discretion of the Executive Officer or probation monitor to modify as opposed to a ÒPetition for ModificationÓ under the Administrative Procedure Act.  The licensee shall meet the following criteria before submitting a request (petition) to return to full time practice:  1.

Effective January 1, 2017 1 Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct Copyright © 2017 by the American Psychological Association. 0003-066X ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     INTRODUCTION AND APPLICABILITY The American Psychological AssociationÕs (APAÕs) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (hereinafter referred to as the Ethics Code) consists of an Introduction, a Preamble, five General Principles (A-E), and specific Ethical Standards. The Introduction discusses the intent, organization, procedural considerations, and scope of application of the Ethics Code. The Preamble and General Principles are aspirational goals to guide psycholo- gists toward the highest ideals of psychology. Although the Preamble and General Principles are not themselves en- forceable rules, they should be considered by psychologists in arriving at an ethical course of action. The Ethical Stan- dards set forth enforceable rules for conduct as psycholo- gists. Most of the Ethical Standards are written broadly, in order to apply to psychologists in varied roles, although the application of an Ethical Standard may vary depending on the context. The Ethical Standards are not exhaustive. The fact that a given conduct is not specifically addressed by an Ethical Standard does not mean that it is necessarily either ethical or unethical. This Ethics Code applies only to psychologistsÕ ac- tivities that are part of their scientific, educational, or profes- sional roles as psychologists. Areas covered include but are not limited to the clinical, counseling, and school practice of psychology; research; teaching; supervision of trainees; public service; policy development; social intervention; development of assessment instruments; conducting as- sessments; educational counseling; organizational consult- ing; forensic activities; program design and evaluation; and administration. This Ethics Code applies to these activities across a variety of contexts, such as in person, postal, tele- phone, Internet, and other electronic transmissions. These activities shall be distinguished from the purely private con- duct of psychologists, which is not within the purview of the Ethics Code. Membership in the APA commits members and stu- dent affiliates to comply with the standards of the APA Ethics In addition, APA may take action against a member after his or her conviction of a felony, expulsion or suspension from an affiliated state psychological association, or suspension or loss of licensure. When the sanction to be imposed by APA is less than expulsion, the 2001 Rules and Procedures do not guarantee an opportunity for an in-person hearing, but gen- erally provide that complaints will be resolved only on the basis of a submitted record. The Ethics Code is intended to provide guidance for psychologists and standards of professional conduct that can be applied by the APA and by other bodies that choose to adopt them. The Ethics Code is not intended to be a basis of civil liability. Whether a psychologist has violated the Eth- ics Code standards does not by itself determine whether the psychologist is legally liable in a court action, whether a contract is enforceable, or whether other legal consequences occur.  The American Psychological AssociationÕs Council of Representatives ad- opted this version of the APA Ethics Code during its meeting on August 21, 2002. The Code became effective on June 1, 2003. The Council of Represen- tatives amended this version of the Ethics Code on February 20, 2010, effec- tive June 1, 2010, and on August 3, 2016, effective January 1, 2017. (see p. 16 of this pamphlet). Inquiries concerning the substance or interpretation of the APA Ethics Code should be addressed to the Office of Ethics, American Psychological Association, 750 First St. NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242. This Ethics Code and information regarding the Code can be found on the APA website, http://www.apa.org/ethics. The standards in this Ethics Code will be used to adjudicate complaints brought concerning alleged conduct occurring on or after the effective date. Complaints will be adjudicated on the basis of the version of the Ethics Code that was in effect at the time the conduct occurred. The APA has previously published its Ethics Code, or amendments there- to, as follows: American Psychological Association.

As used in this Ethics Code, the term reasonable means the prevailing professional judgment of psychologists engaged in similar activities in similar circumstances, given the knowledge the psychologist had or should have had at the time. In the process of making decisions regarding their professional behavior, psychologists must consider this Ethics Code in addition to applicable laws and psychol- ogy board regulations. In applying the Ethics Code to their professional work, psychologists may consider other ma- terials and guidelines that have been adopted or endorsed by scientific and professional psychological organizations and the dictates of their own conscience, as well as consult with others within the field. If this Ethics Code establishes a higher standard of conduct than is required by law, psy- chologists must meet the higher ethical standard. If psy- chologistsÕ ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regu- lations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists make known their commitment to this Ethics Code and take steps to resolve the conflict in a responsible manner in keeping with basic principles of human rights. PREAMBLE Psychologists are committed to increasing scientific and professional knowledge of behavior and peopleÕs un- derstanding of themselves and others and to the use of such knowledge to improve the condition of individuals, organi- zations, and society. Psychologists respect and protect civil and human rights and the central importance of freedom of inquiry and expression in research, teaching, and publica- tion. They strive to help the public in developing informed judgments and choices concerning human behavior. In do- ing so, they perform many roles, such as researcher, edu- cator, diagnostician, therapist, supervisor, consultant, ad- ministrator, social interventionist, and expert witness. This Ethics Code provides a common set of principles and stan- dards upon which psychologists build their professional and scientific work. This Ethics Code is intended to provide specific standards to cover most situations encountered by psy- chologists. It has as its goals the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work and the education of members, students, and the public re- garding ethical standards of the discipline. The development of a dynamic set of ethical stan- dards for psychologistsÕ work-related conduct requires a personal commitment and lifelong effort to act ethically; to encourage ethical behavior by students, supervisees, employees, and colleagues; and to consult with others con- cerning ethical problems. GENERAL PRINCIPLES This section consists of General Principles. General Principles, as opposed to Ethical Standards, are aspiration- al in nature. Their intent is to guide and inspire psycholo- gists toward the very highest ethical ideals of the profes- sion. General Principles, in contrast to Ethical Standards, do not represent obligations and should not form the basis for imposing sanctions. Relying upon General Principles for either of these reasons distorts both their meaning and purpose. Principle A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence Psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm. In their profession- al actions, psychologists seek to safeguard the welfare and rights of those with whom they interact professionally and other affected persons, and the welfare of animal subjects of research. When conflicts occur among psychologistsÕ obli- gations or concerns, they attempt to resolve these conflicts in a responsible fashion that avoids or minimizes harm. Be- cause psychologistsÕ scientific and professional judgments and actions may affect the lives of others, they are alert to and guard against personal, financial, social, organizational, or political factors that might lead to misuse of their influ- ence. Psychologists strive to be aware of the possible effect of their own physical and mental health on their ability to help those with whom they work. Principle B: Fidelity and Responsibility Psychologists establish relationships of trust with those with whom they work. They are aware of their pro- fessional and scientific responsibilities to society and to the specific communities in which they work. Psychologists uphold professional standards of conduct, clarify their pro- fessional roles and obligations, accept appropriate respon- sibility for their behavior, and seek to manage conflicts of interest that could lead to exploitation or harm. Psycholo- gists consult with, refer to, or cooperate with other profes- sionals and institutions to the extent needed to serve the best interests of those with whom they work. They are con- cerned about the ethical compliance of their colleaguesÕ scientific and professional conduct. Psychologists strive to contribute a portion of their professional time for little or no compensation or personal advantage. Principle C: Integrity Psychologists seek to promote accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  Effective January 1, 2017 PreambleÐPrinciple C 3 ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     psychology. In these activities psychologists do not steal, cheat, or engage in fraud, subterfuge, or intentional mis- representation of fact. Psychologists strive to keep their promises and to avoid unwise or unclear commitments. In situations in which deception may be ethically justifiable to maximize benefits and minimize harm, psychologists have a serious obligation to consider the need for, the possible consequences of, and their responsibility to correct any re- sulting mistrust or other harmful effects that arise from the use of such techniques. Principle D: Justice Psychologists recognize that fairness and justice entitle all persons to access to and benefit from the con- tributions of psychology and to equal quality in the pro- cesses, procedures, and services being conducted by psy- chologists. Psychologists exercise reasonable judgment and take precautions to ensure that their potential biases, the boundaries of their competence, and the limitations of their expertise do not lead to or condone unjust practices. Principle E: Respect for PeopleÕs Rights and Dignity Psychologists respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confiden- tiality, and self-determination. Psychologists are aware that special safeguards may be necessary to protect the rights and welfare of persons or communities whose vulnerabili- ties impair autonomous decision making. Psychologists are aware of and respect cultural, individual, and role differ- ences, including those based on age, gender, gender iden- tity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status, and consider these factors when working with members of such groups. Psychologists try to eliminate the effect on their work of biases based on those factors, and they do not knowingly participate in or condone activities of others based upon such prejudices. ETHICAL STANDARDS 1. Resolving Ethical Issues 1.01 Misuse of PsychologistsÕ Work If psychologists learn of misuse or misrepresenta- tion of their work, they take reasonable steps to correct or minimize the misuse or misrepresentation. 1.02 Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority If psychologistsÕ ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code, and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights. 1.03 Conflicts Between Ethics and Organizational Demands If the demands of an organization with which psy- chologists are affiliated or for whom they are working are in conflict with this Ethics Code, psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code, and take reasonable steps to resolve the con- flict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Stan- dards of the Ethics Code. Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights. 1.04 Informal Resolution of Ethical Violations When psychologists believe that there may have been an ethical violation by another psychologist, they at- tempt to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual, if an informal resolution appears appropri- ate and the intervention does not violate any confidential- ity rights that may be involved. (See also Standards 1.02, Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority, and 1.03, Conflicts Between Ethics and Organizational Demands.) 1.05 Reporting Ethical Violations If an apparent ethical violation has substantially harmed or is likely to substantially harm a person or organi- zation and is not appropriate for informal resolution under Standard 1.04, Informal Resolution of Ethical Violations, or is not resolved properly in that fashion, psychologists take further action appropriate to the situation. Such ac- tion might include referral to state or national committees on professional ethics, to state licensing boards, or to the appropriate institutional authorities. This standard does not apply when an intervention would violate confidential- ity rights or when psychologists have been retained to re- view the work of another psychologist whose professional conduct is in question. (See also Standard 1.02, Conflicts Between Ethics and Law, Regulations, or Other Governing Legal Authority.) 1.06 Cooperating with Ethics Committees Psychologists cooperate in ethics investigations, proceedings, and resulting requirements of the APA or any affiliated state psychological association to which they be- long. In doing so, they address any confidentiality issues. Failure to cooperate is itself an ethics violation. However, making a request for deferment of adjudication of an eth- ics complaint pending the outcome of litigation does not alone constitute noncooperation.  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  4       Principle DÐStandard 1.06 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     1.07 Improper Complaints Psychologists do not file or encourage the filing of ethics complaints that are made with reckless disregard for or willful ignorance of facts that would disprove the allegation. 1.08 Unfair Discrimination Against Complainants and Respondents Psychologists do not deny persons employment, advancement, admissions to academic or other programs, tenure, or promotion, based solely upon their having made or their being the subject of an ethics complaint. This does not preclude taking action based upon the outcome of such proceedings or considering other appropriate information. 2. Competence 2.01 Boundaries of Competence (a) Psychologists provide services, teach, and con- duct research with populations and in areas only within the boundaries of their competence, based on their education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, or professional experience. (b) Where scientific or professional knowledge in the discipline of psychology establishes that an understand- ing of factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual ori- entation, disability, language, or socioeconomic status is essential for effective implementation of their services or research, psychologists have or obtain the training, experi- ence, consultation, or supervision necessary to ensure the competence of their services, or they make appropriate re- ferrals, except as provided in Standard 2.02, Providing Ser- vices in Emergencies. (c) Psychologists planning to provide services, teach, or conduct research involving populations, areas, techniques, or technologies new to them undertake rel- evant education, training, supervised experience, consulta- tion, or study. (d) When psychologists are asked to provide servic- es to individuals for whom appropriate mental health ser- vices are not available and for which psychologists have not obtained the competence necessary, psychologists with closely related prior training or experience may provide such services in order to ensure that services are not denied if they make a reasonable effort to obtain the competence required by using relevant research, training, consultation, or study. (e) In those emerging areas in which generally rec- ognized standards for preparatory training do not yet exist, psychologists nevertheless take reasonable steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients/pa- tients, students, supervisees, research participants, organi- zational clients, and others from harm. (f) When assuming forensic roles, psychologists are or become reasonably familiar with the judicial or adminis- trative rules governing their roles. 2.02 Providing Services in Emergencies In emergencies, when psychologists provide ser- vices to individuals for whom other mental health services are not available and for which psychologists have not ob- tained the necessary training, psychologists may provide such services in order to ensure that services are not denied. The services are discontinued as soon as the emergency has ended or appropriate services are available. 2.03 Maintaining Competence Psychologists undertake ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competence. 2.04 Bases for Scientific and Professional Judgments PsychologistsÕ work is based upon established scien- tific and professional knowledge of the discipline. (See also Standards 2.01e, Boundaries of Competence, and 10.01b, Informed Consent to Therapy.) 2.05 Delegation of Work to Others Psychologists who delegate work to employees, supervisees, or research or teaching assistants or who use the services of others, such as interpreters, take reasonable steps to (1) avoid delegating such work to persons who have a multiple relationship with those being served that would likely lead to exploitation or loss of objectivity; (2) authorize only those responsibilities that such persons can be expected to perform competently on the basis of their education, training, or experience, either independently or with the level of supervision being provided; and (3) see that such persons perform these services competently. (See also Standards 2.02, Providing Services in Emergencies; 3.05, Multiple Relationships; 4.01, Maintaining Confiden- tiality; 9.01, Bases for Assessments; 9.02, Use of Assess- ments; 9.03, Informed Consent in Assessments; and 9.07, Assessment by Unqualified Persons.) 2.06 Personal Problems and Conflicts (a) Psychologists refrain from initiating an activity when they know or should know that there is a substantial likelihood that their personal problems will prevent them from performing their work-related activities in a compe- tent manner. (b) When psychologists become aware of personal problems that may interfere with their performing work- related duties adequately, they take appropriate measures, such as obtaining professional consultation or assistance, and determine whether they should limit, suspend, or ter- minate their work-related duties. (See also Standard 10.10, Terminating Therapy.) Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 1.07ÐStandard 2.06 5 Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     3. Human Relations 3.01 Unfair Discrimination In their work-related activities, psychologists do not engage in unfair discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, re- ligion, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status, or any basis proscribed by law. 3.02 Sexual Harassment Psychologists do not engage in sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is sexual solicitation, physical advances, or verbal or nonverbal conduct that is sexual in nature, that occurs in connection with the psychologistÕs activities or roles as a psychologist, and that either (1) is unwelcome, is offensive, or creates a hostile workplace or educational environment, and the psychologist knows or is told this or (2) is sufficiently severe or intense to be abusive to a rea- sonable person in the context. Sexual harassment can con- sist of a single intense or severe act or of multiple persistent or pervasive acts. (See also Standard 1.08, Unfair Discrimi- nation Against Complainants and Respondents.) 3.03 Other Harassment Psychologists do not knowingly engage in behavior that is harassing or demeaning to persons with whom they interact in their work based on factors such as those per- sonsÕ age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, lan- guage, or socioeconomic status. 3.04 Avoiding Harm (a) Psychologists take reasonable steps to avoid harming their clients/patients, students, supervisees, re- search participants, organizational clients, and others with whom they work, and to minimize harm where it is foresee- able and unavoidable. (b) Psychologists do not participate in, facilitate, as- sist, or otherwise engage in torture, defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person, or in any other cruel, inhuman, or degrading behavior that violates 3.04a. 3.05 Multiple Relationships (a) A multiple relationship occurs when a psycholo- gist is in a professional role with a person and (1) at the same time is in another role with the same person, (2) at the same time is in a relationship with a person closely as- sociated with or related to the person with whom the psy- chologist has the professional relationship, or (3) promises to enter into another relationship in the future with the person or a person closely associated with or related to the person. A psychologist refrains from entering into a mul- tiple relationship if the multiple relationship could reason- ably be expected to impair the psychologistÕs objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing his or her func- tions as a psychologist, or otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the professional relation- ship exists. Multiple relationships that would not reasonably be expected to cause impairment or risk exploitation or harm are not unethical. (b) If a psychologist finds that, due to unforeseen factors, a potentially harmful multiple relationship has arisen, the psychologist takes reasonable steps to resolve it with due regard for the best interests of the affected person and maximal compliance with the Ethics Code. (c) When psychologists are required by law, insti- tutional policy, or extraordinary circumstances to serve in more than one role in judicial or administrative proceed- ings, at the outset they clarify role expectations and the ex- tent of confidentiality and thereafter as changes occur. (See also Standards 3.04, Avoiding Harm, and 3.07, Third-Party Requests for Services.) 3.06 Conflict of Interest Psychologists refrain from taking on a professional role when personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships could reasonably be ex- pected to (1) impair their objectivity, competence, or ef- fectiveness in performing their functions as psychologists or (2) expose the person or organization with whom the professional relationship exists to harm or exploitation. 3.07 Third-Party Requests for Services When psychologists agree to provide services to a person or entity at the request of a third party, psycholo- gists attempt to clarify at the outset of the service the na- ture of the relationship with all individuals or organizations involved. This clarification includes the role of the psychol- ogist (e.g., therapist, consultant, diagnostician, or expert witness), an identification of who is the client, the probable uses of the services provided or the information obtained, and the fact that there may be limits to confidentiality. (See also Standards 3.05, Multiple relationships, and 4.02, Dis- cussing the Limits of Confidentiality.) 3.08 Exploitative Relationships Psychologists do not exploit persons over whom they have supervisory, evaluative or other authority such as clients/patients, students, supervisees, research partici- pants, and employees. (See also Standards 3.05, Multiple Relationships; 6.04, Fees and Financial Arrangements; 6.05, Barter with Clients/Patients; 7.07, Sexual Relation- ships with Students and Supervisees; 10.05, Sexual Intima-  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  6       Standard 3.01ÐStandard 3.08 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     cies with Current Therapy Clients/Patients; 10.06, Sexual Intimacies with Relatives or Significant Others of Current Therapy Clients/Patients; 10.07, Therapy with Former Sexual Partners; and 10.08, Sexual Intimacies with Former Therapy Clients/Patients.) 3.09 Cooperation with Other Professionals When indicated and professionally appropriate, psychologists cooperate with other professionals in order to serve their clients/patients effectively and appropriately. (See also Standard 4.05, Disclosures.) 3.10 Informed Consent (a) When psychologists conduct research or pro- vide assessment, therapy, counseling, or consulting servic- es in person or via electronic transmission or other forms of communication, they obtain the informed consent of the individual or individuals using language that is reason- ably understandable to that person or persons except when conducting such activities without consent is mandated by law or governmental regulation or as otherwise provided in this Ethics Code. (See also Standards 8.02, Informed Con- sent to Research; 9.03, Informed Consent in Assessments; and 10.01, Informed Consent to Therapy.) (b) For persons who are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists nevertheless (1) provide an appropriate explanation, (2) seek the individualÕs assent, (3) consider such personsÕ preferences and best interests, and (4) obtain appropriate permission from a legally authorized person, if such substitute consent is permitted or required by law. When consent by a legally authorized person is not permitted or required by law, psychologists take reasonable steps to protect the individualÕs rights and welfare. (c) When psychological services are court ordered or otherwise mandated, psychologists inform the indi- vidual of the nature of the anticipated services, including whether the services are court ordered or mandated and any limits of confidentiality, before proceeding. (d) Psychologists appropriately document written or oral consent, permission, and assent. (See also Stan- dards 8.02, Informed Consent to Research; 9.03, Informed Consent in Assessments; and 10.01, Informed Consent to Therapy.) 3.11 Psychological Services Delivered to or Through Organizations (a) Psychologists delivering services to or through organizations provide information beforehand to clients and when appropriate those directly affected by the services about (1) the nature and objectives of the services, (2) the intended recipients, (3) which of the individuals are clients, (4) the relationship the psychologist will have with each per- son and the organization, (5) the probable uses of services provided and information obtained, (6) who will have ac- cess to the information, and (7) limits of confidentiality. As soon as feasible, they provide information about the results and conclusions of such services to appropriate persons. (b) If psychologists will be precluded by law or by organizational roles from providing such information to particular individuals or groups, they so inform those indi- viduals or groups at the outset of the service. 3.12 Interruption of Psychological Services Unless otherwise covered by contract, psycholo- gists make reasonable efforts to plan for facilitating services in the event that psychological services are interrupted by factors such as the psychologistÕs illness, death, unavailabil- ity, relocation, or retirement or by the clientÕs/patientÕs re- location or financial limitations. (See also Standard 6.02c, Maintenance, Dissemination, and Disposal of Confidential Records of Professional and Scientific Work.) 4. Privacy and Confidentiality 4.01 Maintaining Confidentiality Psychologists have a primary obligation and take reasonable precautions to protect confidential information obtained through or stored in any medium, recognizing that the extent and limits of confidentiality may be regu- lated by law or established by institutional rules or profes- sional or scientific relationship. (See also Standard 2.05, Delegation of Work to Others.) 4.02 Discussing the Limits of Confidentiality (a) Psychologists discuss with persons (including, to the extent feasible, persons who are legally incapable of giving informed consent and their legal representatives) and organizations with whom they establish a scientific or professional relationship (1) the relevant limits of confi- dentiality and (2) the foreseeable uses of the information generated through their psychological activities. (See also Standard 3.10, Informed Consent.) (b) Unless it is not feasible or is contraindicated, the discussion of confidentiality occurs at the outset of the rela- tionship and thereafter as new circumstances may warrant. (c) Psychologists who offer services, products, or information via electronic transmission inform clients/pa- tients of the risks to privacy and limits of confidentiality. 4.03 Recording Before recording the voices or images of individuals to whom they provide services, psychologists obtain per- mission from all such persons or their legal representatives. (See also Standards 8.03, Informed Consent for Recording Voices and Images in Research; 8.05, Dispensing with In- formed Consent for Research; and 8.07, Deception in Re- search.)  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 3.09ÐStandard 4.03 7 ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     4.04 Minimizing Intrusions on Privacy (a) Psychologists include in written and oral reports and consultations, only information germane to the pur- pose for which the communication is made. (b) Psychologists discuss confidential information obtained in their work only for appropriate scientific or professional purposes and only with persons clearly con- cerned with such matters. 4.05 Disclosures (a) Psychologists may disclose confidential infor- mation with the appropriate consent of the organizational client, the individual client/patient, or another legally au- thorized person on behalf of the client/patient unless pro- hibited by law. (b) Psychologists disclose confidential information without the consent of the individual only as mandated by law, or where permitted by law for a valid purpose such as to (1) provide needed professional services; (2) obtain appropriate professional consultations; (3) protect the cli- ent/patient, psychologist, or others from harm; or (4) ob- tain payment for services from a client/patient, in which instance disclosure is limited to the minimum that is neces- sary to achieve the purpose. (See also Standard 6.04e, Fees and Financial Arrangements.) 4.06 Consultations When consulting with colleagues, (1) psychologists do not disclose confidential information that reasonably could lead to the identification of a client/patient, research participant, or other person or organization with whom they have a confidential relationship unless they have ob- tained the prior consent of the person or organization or the disclosure cannot be avoided, and (2) they disclose in- formation only to the extent necessary to achieve the pur- poses of the consultation. (See also Standard 4.01, Main- taining Confidentiality.) 4.07 Use of Confidential Information for Didactic or Other Purposes Psychologists do not disclose in their writings, lec- tures, or other public media, confidential, personally iden- tifiable information concerning their clients/patients, stu- dents, research participants, organizational clients, or other recipients of their services that they obtained during the course of their work, unless (1) they take reasonable steps to disguise the person or organization, (2) the person or organization has consented in writing, or (3) there is legal authorization for doing so. 5. Advertising and Other Public Statements 5.01 Avoidance of False or Deceptive Statements (a) Public statements include but are not limited to paid or unpaid advertising, product endorsements, grant applications, licensing applications, other credentialing applications, brochures, printed matter, directory listings, personal resumes or curricula vitae, or comments for use in media such as print or electronic transmission, statements in legal proceedings, lectures and public oral presentations, and published materials. Psychologists do not knowingly make public statements that are false, deceptive, or fraud- ulent concerning their research, practice, or other work activities or those of persons or organizations with which they are affiliated. (b) Psychologists do not make false, deceptive, or fraudulent statements concerning (1) their training, ex- perience, or competence; (2) their academic degrees; (3) their credentials; (4) their institutional or association affili- ations; (5) their services; (6) the scientific or clinical ba- sis for, or results or degree of success of, their services; (7) their fees; or (8) their publications or research findings. (c) Psychologists claim degrees as credentials for their health services only if those degrees (1) were earned from a regionally accredited educational institution or (2) were the basis for psychology licensure by the state in which they practice. 5.02 Statements by Others (a) Psychologists who engage others to create or place public statements that promote their professional practice, products, or activities retain professional respon- sibility for such statements. (b) Psychologists do not compensate employees of press, radio, television, or other communication media in return for publicity in a news item. (See also Standard 1.01, Misuse of PsychologistsÕ Work.) (c) A paid advertisement relating to psychologistsÕ activities must be identified or clearly recognizable as such. 5.03 Descriptions of Workshops and Non-Degree-Granting Educational Programs To the degree to which they exercise control, psy- chologists responsible for announcements, catalogs, bro- chures, or advertisements describing workshops, seminars, or other non-degree-granting educational programs ensure that they accurately describe the audience for which the program is intended, the educational objectives, the pre- senters, and the fees involved. 5.04 Media Presentations When psychologists provide public advice or com- ment via print, Internet, or other electronic transmission,  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  8       Standard 4.04ÐStandard 5.04 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     they take precautions to ensure that statements (1) are based on their professional knowledge, training, or expe- rience in accord with appropriate psychological literature and practice; (2) are otherwise consistent with this Ethics Code; and (3) do not indicate that a professional relation- ship has been established with the recipient. (See also Stan- dard 2.04, Bases for Scientific and Professional Judgments.) 5.05 Testimonials Psychologists do not solicit testimonials from cur- rent therapy clients/patients or other persons who because of their particular circumstances are vulnerable to undue influence. 5.06 In-Person Solicitation Psychologists do not engage, directly or through agents, in uninvited in-person solicitation of business from actual or potential therapy clients/patients or other per- sons who because of their particular circumstances are vul- nerable to undue influence. However, this prohibition does not preclude (1) attempting to implement appropriate collateral contacts for the purpose of benefiting an already engaged therapy client/patient or (2) providing disaster or community outreach services. 6. Record Keeping and Fees 6.01 Documentation of Professional and Scientific Work and Maintenance of Records Psychologists create, and to the extent the records are under their control, maintain, disseminate, store, retain, and dispose of records and data relating to their profession- al and scientific work in order to (1) facilitate provision of services later by them or by other professionals, (2) allow for replication of research design and analyses, (3) meet in- stitutional requirements, (4) ensure accuracy of billing and payments, and (5) ensure compliance with law. (See also Standard 4.01, Maintaining Confidentiality.) 6.02 Maintenance, Dissemination, and Disposal of Confidential Records of Professional and Scientific Work (a) Psychologists maintain confidentiality in creat- ing, storing, accessing, transferring, and disposing of records under their control, whether these are written, automated, or in any other medium. (See also Standards 4.01, Maintaining Confidentiality, and 6.01, Documentation of Professional and Scientific Work and Maintenance of Records.) (b) If confidential information concerning recipi- ents of psychological services is entered into databases or systems of records available to persons whose access has not been consented to by the recipient, psychologists use coding or other techniques to avoid the inclusion of per- sonal identifiers. (c) Psychologists make plans in advance to facilitate the appropriate transfer and to protect the confidentiality of records and data in the event of psychologistsÕ withdraw- al from positions or practice. (See also Standards 3.12, In- terruption of Psychological Services, and 10.09, Interrup- tion of Therapy.) 6.03 Withholding Records for Nonpayment Psychologists may not withhold records under their control that are requested and needed for a clientÕs/ patientÕs emergency treatment solely because payment has not been received. 6.04 Fees and Financial Arrangements (a) As early as is feasible in a professional or scientif- ic relationship, psychologists and recipients of psychologi- cal services reach an agreement specifying compensation and billing arrangements. (b) PsychologistsÕ fee practices are consistent with law. (c) Psychologists do not misrepresent their fees. (d) If limitations to services can be anticipated be- cause of limitations in financing, this is discussed with the recipient of services as early as is feasible. (See also Stan- dards 10.09, Interruption of Therapy, and 10.10, Terminat- ing Therapy.) (e) If the recipient of services does not pay for ser- vices as agreed, and if psychologists intend to use collection agencies or legal measures to collect the fees, psychologists first inform the person that such measures will be taken and provide that person an opportunity to make prompt pay- ment. (See also Standards 4.05, Disclosures; 6.03, With- holding Records for Nonpayment; and 10.01, Informed Consent to Therapy.) 6.05 Barter with Clients/Patients Barter is the acceptance of goods, services, or other nonmonetary remuneration from clients/patients in return for psychological services. Psychologists may barter only if (1) it is not clinically contraindicated, and (2) the resulting arrangement is not exploitative. (See also Standards 3.05, Multiple Relationships, and 6.04, Fees and Financial Ar- rangements.) 6.06 Accuracy in Reports to Payors and Funding Sources In their reports to payors for services or sources of research funding, psychologists take reasonable steps to ensure the accurate reporting of the nature of the service provided or research conducted, the fees, charges, or pay- ments, and where applicable, the identity of the provider, the findings, and the diagnosis. (See also Standards 4.01, Maintaining Confidentiality; 4.04, Minimizing Intrusions on Privacy; and 4.05, Disclosures.)  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 5.05ÐStandard 6.06 9 ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     6.07 Referrals and Fees When psychologists pay, receive payment from, or divide fees with another professional, other than in an em- ployer-employee relationship, the payment to each is based on the services provided (clinical, consultative, administra- tive, or other) and is not based on the referral itself. (See also Standard 3.09, Cooperation with Other Profession- als.) 7. Education and Training 7.01 Design of Education and Training Programs Psychologists responsible for education and train- ing programs take reasonable steps to ensure that the pro- grams are designed to provide the appropriate knowledge and proper experiences, and to meet the requirements for licensure, certification, or other goals for which claims are made by the program. (See also Standard 5.03, Descrip- tions of Workshops and Non-Degree-Granting Education- al Programs.) 7.02 Descriptions of Education and Training Programs Psychologists responsible for education and train- ing programs take reasonable steps to ensure that there is a current and accurate description of the program content (including participation in required course- or program-re- lated counseling, psychotherapy, experiential groups, con- sulting projects, or community service), training goals and objectives, stipends and benefits, and requirements that must be met for satisfactory completion of the program. This information must be made readily available to all in- terested parties. 7.03 Accuracy in Teaching (a) Psychologists take reasonable steps to ensure that course syllabi are accurate regarding the subject matter to be covered, bases for evaluating progress, and the nature of course experiences. This standard does not preclude an instructor from modifying course content or requirements when the instructor considers it pedagogically necessary or desirable, so long as students are made aware of these mod- ifications in a manner that enables them to fulfill course re- quirements. (See also Standard 5.01, Avoidance of False or Deceptive Statements.) (b) When engaged in teaching or training, psychol- ogists present psychological information accurately. (See also Standard 2.03, Maintaining Competence.) 7.04 Student Disclosure of Personal Information Psychologists do not require students or super- visees to disclose personal information in course- or pro- gram-related activities, either orally or in writing, regarding sexual history, history of abuse and neglect, psychologi- cal treatment, and relationships with parents, peers, and spouses or significant others except if (1) the program or training facility has clearly identified this requirement in its admissions and program materials or (2) the information is necessary to evaluate or obtain assistance for students whose personal problems could reasonably be judged to be preventing them from performing their training- or profes- sionally related activities in a competent manner or posing a threat to the students or others. 7.05 Mandatory Individual or Group Therapy (a) When individual or group therapy is a program or course requirement, psychologists responsible for that program allow students in undergraduate and graduate programs the option of selecting such therapy from prac- titioners unaffiliated with the program. (See also Standard 7.02, Descriptions of Education and Training Programs.) (b) Faculty who are or are likely to be responsible for evaluating studentsÕ academic performance do not themselves provide that therapy. (See also Standard 3.05, Multiple Relationships.) 7.06 Assessing Student and Supervisee Performance (a) In academic and supervisory relationships, psy- chologists establish a timely and specific process for pro- viding feedback to students and supervisees. Information regarding the process is provided to the student at the be- ginning of supervision. (b) Psychologists evaluate students and supervisees on the basis of their actual performance on relevant and es- tablished program requirements. 7.07 Sexual Relationships with Students and Supervisees Psychologists do not engage in sexual relationships with students or supervisees who are in their department, agency, or training center or over whom psychologists have or are likely to have evaluative authority. (See also Standard 3.05, Multiple Relationships.) 8. Research and Publication 8.01 Institutional Approval When institutional approval is required, psycholo- gists provide accurate information about their research proposals and obtain approval prior to conducting the re- search. They conduct the research in accordance with the approved research protocol. 8.02 Informed Consent to Research (a) When obtaining informed consent as required in Standard 3.10, Informed Consent, psychologists inform participants about (1) the purpose of the research, expect-  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  10     Standard 6.07ÐStandard 8.02 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     ed duration, and procedures; (2) their right to decline to participate and to withdraw from the research once par- ticipation has begun; (3) the foreseeable consequences of declining or withdrawing; (4) reasonably foreseeable fac- tors that may be expected to influence their willingness to participate such as potential risks, discomfort, or adverse effects; (5) any prospective research benefits; (6) limits of confidentiality; (7) incentives for participation; and (8) whom to contact for questions about the research and re- search participantsÕ rights. They provide opportunity for the prospective participants to ask questions and receive answers. (See also Standards 8.03, Informed Consent for Recording Voices and Images in Research; 8.05, Dispens- ing with Informed Consent for Research; and 8.07, Decep- tion in Research.) (b) Psychologists conducting intervention research involving the use of experimental treatments clarify to par- ticipants at the outset of the research (1) the experimental nature of the treatment; (2) the services that will or will not be available to the control group(s) if appropriate; (3) the means by which assignment to treatment and control groups will be made; (4) available treatment alternatives if an individual does not wish to participate in the research or wishes to withdraw once a study has begun; and (5) com- pensation for or monetary costs of participating including, if appropriate, whether reimbursement from the partici- pant or a third-party payor will be sought. (See also Stan- dard 8.02a, Informed Consent to Research.) 8.03 Informed Consent for Recording Voices and Images in Research Psychologists obtain informed consent from re- search participants prior to recording their voices or images for data collection unless (1) the research consists solely of naturalistic observations in public places, and it is not anticipated that the recording will be used in a manner that could cause personal identification or harm, or (2) the re- search design includes deception, and consent for the use of the recording is obtained during debriefing. (See also Standard 8.07, Deception in Research.) 8.04 Client/Patient, Student, and Subordinate Research Participants (a) When psychologists conduct research with cli- ents/patients, students, or subordinates as participants, psychologists take steps to protect the prospective par- ticipants from adverse consequences of declining or with- drawing from participation. (b) When research participation is a course require- ment or an opportunity for extra credit, the prospective participant is given the choice of equitable alternative ac- tivities. 8.05 Dispensing with Informed Consent for Research Psychologists may dispense with informed consent only (1) where research would not reasonably be assumed to create distress or harm and involves (a) the study of nor- mal educational practices, curricula, or classroom manage- ment methods conducted in educational settings; (b) only anonymous questionnaires, naturalistic observations, or archival research for which disclosure of responses would not place participants at risk of criminal or civil liability or damage their financial standing, employability, or reputa- tion, and confidentiality is protected; or (c) the study of factors related to job or organization effectiveness conduct- ed in organizational settings for which there is no risk to participantsÕ employability, and confidentiality is protected or (2) where otherwise permitted by law or federal or insti- tutional regulations. 8.06 Offering Inducements for Research Participation (a) Psychologists make reasonable efforts to avoid offering excessive or inappropriate financial or other in- ducements for research participation when such induce- ments are likely to coerce participation. (b) When offering professional services as an in- ducement for research participation, psychologists clarify the nature of the services, as well as the risks, obligations, and limitations. (See also Standard 6.05, Barter with Cli- ents/Patients.) 8.07 Deception in Research (a) Psychologists do not conduct a study involv- ing deception unless they have determined that the use of deceptive techniques is justified by the studyÕs significant prospective scientific, educational, or applied value and that effective nondeceptive alternative procedures are not feasible. (b) Psychologists do not deceive prospective partic- ipants about research that is reasonably expected to cause physical pain or severe emotional distress. (c) Psychologists explain any deception that is an integral feature of the design and conduct of an experiment to participants as early as is feasible, preferably at the con- clusion of their participation, but no later than at the con- clusion of the data collection, and permit participants to withdraw their data. (See also Standard 8.08, Debriefing.) 8.08 Debriefing (a) Psychologists provide a prompt opportunity for participants to obtain appropriate information about the nature, results, and conclusions of the research, and they take reasonable steps to correct any misconceptions that participants may have of which the psychologists are aware.  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 8.03ÐStandard 8.08 11 ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     (b) If scientific or humane values justify delaying or withholding this information, psychologists take reason- able measures to reduce the risk of harm. (c) When psychologists become aware that research procedures have harmed a participant, they take reasonable steps to minimize the harm. 8.09 Humane Care and Use of Animals in Research (a) Psychologists acquire, care for, use, and dispose of animals in compliance with current federal, state, and lo- cal laws and regulations, and with professional standards. (b) Psychologists trained in research methods and experienced in the care of laboratory animals supervise all procedures involving animals and are responsible for en- suring appropriate consideration of their comfort, health, and humane treatment. (c) Psychologists ensure that all individuals under their supervision who are using animals have received instruction in research methods and in the care, mainte- nance, and handling of the species being used, to the extent appropriate to their role. (See also Standard 2.05, Delega- tion of Work to Others.) (d) Psychologists make reasonable efforts to mini- mize the discomfort, infection, illness, and pain of animal subjects. (e) Psychologists use a procedure subjecting ani- mals to pain, stress, or privation only when an alternative procedure is unavailable and the goal is justified by its pro- spective scientific, educational, or applied value. (f) Psychologists perform surgical procedures un- der appropriate anesthesia and follow techniques to avoid infection and minimize pain during and after surgery. (g) When it is appropriate that an animalÕs life be terminated, psychologists proceed rapidly, with an effort to minimize pain and in accordance with accepted proce- dures. 8.10 Reporting Research Results (a) Psychologists do not fabricate data. (See also Standard 5.01a, Avoidance of False or Deceptive State- ments.) (b) If psychologists discover significant errors in their published data, they take reasonable steps to correct such errors in a correction, retraction, erratum, or other ap- propriate publication means. 8.11 Plagiarism Psychologists do not present portions of anotherÕs work or data as their own, even if the other work or data source is cited occasionally. 8.12 Publication Credit (a) Psychologists take responsibility and credit, in- cluding authorship credit, only for work they have actually performed or to which they have substantially contributed. (See also Standard 8.12b, Publication Credit.) (b) Principal authorship and other publication credits accurately reflect the relative scientific or profes- sional contributions of the individuals involved, regardless of their relative status. Mere possession of an institutional position, such as department chair, does not justify author- ship credit. Minor contributions to the research or to the writing for publications are acknowledged appropriately, such as in footnotes or in an introductory statement. (c) Except under exceptional circumstances, a stu- dent is listed as principal author on any multiple-authored article that is substantially based on the studentÕs doctoral dissertation. Faculty advisors discuss publication credit with students as early as feasible and throughout the re- search and publication process as appropriate. (See also Standard 8.12b, Publication Credit.) 8.13 Duplicate Publication of Data Psychologists do not publish, as original data, data that have been previously published. This does not pre- clude republishing data when they are accompanied by proper acknowledgment. 8.14 Sharing Research Data for Verification (a) After research results are published, psycholo- gists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release. This does not preclude psychologists from re- quiring that such individuals or groups be responsible for costs associated with the provision of such information. (b) Psychologists who request data from other psy- chologists to verify the substantive claims through reanaly- sis may use shared data only for the declared purpose. Re- questing psychologists obtain prior written agreement for all other uses of the data. 8.15 Reviewers Psychologists who review material submitted for presentation, publication, grant, or research proposal re- view respect the confidentiality of and the proprietary rights in such information of those who submitted it. 9. Assessment 9.01 Bases for Assessments (a) Psychologists base the opinions contained in their recommendations, reports, and diagnostic or evalu- ative statements, including forensic testimony, on informa-  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  12     Standard 8.09ÐStandard 9.01 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     tion and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings. (See also Standard 2.04, Bases for Scientific and Profes- sional Judgments.) (b) Except as noted in 9.01c, psychologists provide opinions of the psychological characteristics of individuals only after they have conducted an examination of the in- dividuals adequate to support their statements or conclu- sions. When, despite reasonable efforts, such an examina- tion is not practical, psychologists document the efforts they made and the result of those efforts, clarify the prob- able impact of their limited information on the reliability and validity of their opinions, and appropriately limit the nature and extent of their conclusions or recommenda- tions. (See also Standards 2.01, Boundaries of Compe- tence, and 9.06, Interpreting Assessment Results.) (c) When psychologists conduct a record review or provide consultation or supervision and an individual examination is not warranted or necessary for the opinion, psychologists explain this and the sources of information on which they based their conclusions and recommendations. 9.02 Use of Assessments (a) Psychologists administer, adapt, score, interpret, or use assessment techniques, interviews, tests, or instru- ments in a manner and for purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of the usefulness and proper application of the techniques. (b) Psychologists use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population tested. When such valid- ity or reliability has not been established, psychologists describe the strengths and limitations of test results and interpretation. (c) Psychologists use assessment methods that are appropriate to an individualÕs language preference and competence, unless the use of an alternative language is rel- evant to the assessment issues. 9.03 Informed Consent in Assessments (a) Psychologists obtain informed consent for as- sessments, evaluations, or diagnostic services, as described in Standard 3.10, Informed Consent, except when (1) test- ing is mandated by law or governmental regulations; (2) informed consent is implied because testing is conducted as a routine educational, institutional, or organizational activity (e.g., when participants voluntarily agree to assess- ment when applying for a job); or (3) one purpose of the testing is to evaluate decisional capacity. Informed consent includes an explanation of the nature and purpose of the assessment, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and sufficient opportunity for the client/pa- tient to ask questions and receive answers. (b) Psychologists inform persons with questionable capacity to consent or for whom testing is mandated by law or governmental regulations about the nature and purpose of the proposed assessment services, using language that is reasonably understandable to the person being assessed. (c) Psychologists using the services of an inter- preter obtain informed consent from the client/patient to use that interpreter, ensure that confidentiality of test re- sults and test security are maintained, and include in their recommendations, reports, and diagnostic or evaluative statements, including forensic testimony, discussion of any limitations on the data obtained. (See also Standards 2.05, Delegation of Work to Others; 4.01, Maintaining Confi- dentiality; 9.01, Bases for Assessments; 9.06, Interpreting Assessment Results; and 9.07, Assessment by Unqualified Persons.) 9.04 Release of Test Data (a) The term test data refers to raw and scaled scores, client/patient responses to test questions or stimuli, and psychologistsÕ notes and recordings concerning client/ patient statements and behavior during an examination. Those portions of test materials that include client/pa- tient responses are included in the definition of test data. Pursuant to a client/patient release, psychologists provide test data to the client/patient or other persons identified in the release. Psychologists may refrain from releasing test data to protect a client/patient or others from substantial harm or misuse or misrepresentation of the data or the test, recognizing that in many instances release of confidential information under these circumstances is regulated by law. (See also Standard 9.11, Maintaining Test Security.) (b) In the absence of a client/patient release, psy- chologists provide test data only as required by law or court order. 9.05 Test Construction Psychologists who develop tests and other assess- ment techniques use appropriate psychometric procedures and current scientific or professional knowledge for test de- sign, standardization, validation, reduction or elimination of bias, and recommendations for use. 9.06 Interpreting Assessment Results When interpreting assessment results, including automated interpretations, psychologists take into account the purpose of the assessment as well as the various test factors, test-taking abilities, and other characteristics of the person being assessed, such as situational, personal, linguis- tic, and cultural differences, that might affect psychologistsÕ judgments or reduce the accuracy of their interpretations. They indicate any significant limitations of their interpreta- tions. (See also Standards 2.01b and c, Boundaries of Com- petence, and 3.01, Unfair Discrimination.)  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 9.02ÐStandard 9.06 13 ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     9.07 Assessment by Unqualified Persons Psychologists do not promote the use of psycholog- ical assessment techniques by unqualified persons, except when such use is conducted for training purposes with ap- propriate supervision. (See also Standard 2.05, Delegation of Work to Others.) 9.08 Obsolete Tests and Outdated Test Results (a) Psychologists do not base their assessment or intervention decisions or recommendations on data or test results that are outdated for the current purpose. (b) Psychologists do not base such decisions or rec- ommendations on tests and measures that are obsolete and not useful for the current purpose. 9.09 Test Scoring and Interpretation Services (a) Psychologists who offer assessment or scor- ing services to other professionals accurately describe the purpose, norms, validity, reliability, and applications of the procedures and any special qualifications applicable to their use. (b) Psychologists select scoring and interpretation services (including automated services) on the basis of evi- dence of the validity of the program and procedures as well as on other appropriate considerations. (See also Standard 2.01b and c, Boundaries of Competence.) (c) Psychologists retain responsibility for the ap- propriate application, interpretation, and use of assessment instruments, whether they score and interpret such tests themselves or use automated or other services. 9.10 Explaining Assessment Results Regardless of whether the scoring and interpreta- tion are done by psychologists, by employees or assistants, or by automated or other outside services, psychologists take reasonable steps to ensure that explanations of results are given to the individual or designated representative un- less the nature of the relationship precludes provision of an explanation of results (such as in some organizational consulting, preemployment or security screenings, and fo- rensic evaluations), and this fact has been clearly explained to the person being assessed in advance. 9.11 Maintaining Test Security The term test materials refers to manuals, instru- ments, protocols, and test questions or stimuli and does not include test data as defined in Standard 9.04, Release of Test Data. Psychologists make reasonable efforts to main- tain the integrity and security of test materials and other assessment techniques consistent with law and contractual obligations, and in a manner that permits adherence to this Ethics Code. 10. Therapy 10.01 Informed Consent to Therapy (a) When obtaining informed consent to therapy as required in Standard 3.10, Informed Consent, psychol- ogists inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers. (See also Standards 4.02, Discussing the Limits of Confi- dentiality, and 6.04, Fees and Financial Arrangements.) (b) When obtaining informed consent for treat- ment for which generally recognized techniques and proce- dures have not been established, psychologists inform their clients/patients of the developing nature of the treatment, the potential risks involved, alternative treatments that may be available, and the voluntary nature of their participation. (See also Standards 2.01e, Boundaries of Competence, and 3.10, Informed Consent.) (c) When the therapist is a trainee and the legal re- sponsibility for the treatment provided resides with the su- pervisor, the client/patient, as part of the informed consent procedure, is informed that the therapist is in training and is being supervised and is given the name of the supervisor. 10.02 Therapy Involving Couples or Families (a) When psychologists agree to provide services to several persons who have a relationship (such as spouses, significant others, or parents and children), they take rea- sonable steps to clarify at the outset (1) which of the in- dividuals are clients/patients and (2) the relationship the psychologist will have with each person. This clarification includes the psychologistÕs role and the probable uses of the services provided or the information obtained. (See also Standard 4.02, Discussing the Limits of Confidential- ity.) (b) If it becomes apparent that psychologists may be called on to perform potentially conflicting roles (such as family therapist and then witness for one party in di- vorce proceedings), psychologists take reasonable steps to clarify and modify, or withdraw from, roles appropriately. (See also Standard 3.05c, Multiple Relationships.) 10.03 Group Therapy When psychologists provide services to several per- sons in a group setting, they describe at the outset the roles and responsibilities of all parties and the limits of confiden- tiality.  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct  14     Standard 9.07ÐStandard 10.03 Effective January 1, 2017     BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY     10.04 Providing Therapy to Those Served by Others In deciding whether to offer or provide services to those already receiving mental health services elsewhere, psychologists carefully consider the treatment issues and the potential clientÕs/patientÕs welfare. Psychologists dis- cuss these issues with the client/patient or another legally authorized person on behalf of the client/patient in order to minimize the risk of confusion and conflict, consult with the other service providers when appropriate, and proceed with caution and sensitivity to the therapeutic issues. 10.05 Sexual Intimacies with Current Therapy Clients/Patients Psychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with current therapy clients/patients. 10.06 Sexual Intimacies with Relatives or Significant Others of Current Therapy Clients/Patients Psychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with individuals they know to be close relatives, guardians, or significant others of current clients/patients. Psycholo- gists do not terminate therapy to circumvent this standard. 10.07 Therapy with Former Sexual Partners Psychologists do not accept as therapy clients/pa- tients persons with whom they have engaged in sexual in- timacies. 10.08 Sexual Intimacies with Former Therapy Clients/Patients (a) Psychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with former clients/patients for at least two years after ces- sation or termination of therapy. (b) Psychologists do not engage in sexual intimacies with former clients/patients even after a two-year interval except in the most unusual circumstances. Psychologists who engage in such activity after the two years following cessation or termination of therapy and of having no sexual contact with the former client/patient bear the burden of demonstrating that there has been no exploitation, in light of all relevant factors, including (1) the amount of time that has passed since therapy terminated; (2) the nature, dura- tion, and intensity of the therapy; (3) the circumstances of termination; (4) the clientÕs/patientÕs personal history; (5) the clientÕs/patientÕs current mental status; (6) the likeli- hood of adverse impact on the client/patient; and (7) any statements or actions made by the therapist during the course of therapy suggesting or inviting the possibility of a posttermination sexual or romantic relationship with the client/patient. (See also Standard 3.05, Multiple Relation- ships.)  10.09 Interruption of Therapy When entering into employment or contractual re- lationships, psychologists make reasonable efforts to pro- vide for orderly and appropriate resolution of responsibil- ity for client/patient care in the event that the employment or contractual relationship ends, with paramount consid- eration given to the welfare of the client/patient. (See also Standard 3.12, Interruption of Psychological Services.) 10.10 Terminating Therapy (a) Psychologists terminate therapy when it be- comes reasonably clear that the client/patient no longer needs the service, is not likely to benefit, or is being harmed by continued service. (b) Psychologists may terminate therapy when threatened or otherwise endangered by the client/patient or another person with whom the client/patient has a re- lationship. (c) Except where precluded by the actions of cli- ents/patients or third-party payors, prior to termination psychologists provide pretermination counseling and sug- gest alternative service providers as appropriate.  Ethical Principles & Code of Conduct   Effective January 1, 2017 Standard 10.04ÐStandard 10.10 15    ETHICS CODE PRINCIPLES     AMENDMENTS TO THE 2002 ÒETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND CODE OF CONDUCTÓ IN 2010 AND 2016  2010 Amendments Introduction and Applicability If psychologistsÕ ethical responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, psychologists make known their commitment to this Eth- ics Code and take steps to resolve the conflict in a respon- sible manner.

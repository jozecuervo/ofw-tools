## Versioning & Changelog Rules

- Always bump `package.json` version using SemVer (`major.minor.patch`).
- Always add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the new version with date and bullets.
- Keep commits focused. Prefer one functional change per commit with a clear message.

### Example CHANGELOG Entry

```
## 1.2.0 - 2025-08-09
- feat: add specialized Divorce Navigator prompts and templates
- docs: update README with AI Tooling section
```
